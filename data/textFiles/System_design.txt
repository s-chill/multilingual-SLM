The basic study of system design is the understanding of component parts and their subsequent interaction with one another.

Systems design has appeared in a variety of fields, including sustainability, computer/software architecture, and sociology.

If the broader topic of product development "blends the perspective of marketing, design, and manufacturing into a single approach to product development," then design is the act of taking the marketing information and creating the design of the product to be manufactured.

Thus in product development, systems design involves the process of defining and developing systems, such as interfaces and data , for an electronic control system to satisfy specified requirements . Systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development . There is some overlap with the disciplines of systems analysis , systems architecture and systems engineering .

The physical design relates to the actual input and output processes of the system. This is explained in terms of how data is input into a system, how it is verified/authenticated, how it is processed, and how it is displayed.
In physical design, the following requirements about the system are decided.

Put another way, the physical portion of system design can generally be broken down into three sub-tasks:

Online websites, such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix are used by millions of users worldwide. A scalable, highly available system must be designed to accommodate an increasing number of users. Here are the things to consider in designing the system:
