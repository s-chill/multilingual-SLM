The Solnova Solar Power Station is a large CSP power station made up of five separate units of 50 MW each. The facility is part of the Solucar Complex , in Sanl√∫car la Mayor , in Spain , the same area where the PS20 solar power tower is also located. With the commissioning of the third 50 MW unit, the Solnova-IV in August 2010, the power station ranks as one of the largest CSP power stations in the world.

Solnova-I, Solnova-III, and Solnova-IV were commissioned in mid-2010 and are all rated at 50 MWe in installed capacity each. All five plants are built, owned and operated by Abengoa Solar , a Spanish solar power company.

All five power stations, the three commissioned and two under development, will be utilizing parabolic troughs , a technology to use concentrated solar power. The three commissioned power stations are also equipped to support natural gas as its secondary fuel source for power generation.
