Patricio "Paddy" Martinez (1881– August 26, 1969) was an American prospector and shepherd who discovered uranium at Haystack Mesa in the San Juan Basin near Grants, New Mexico , in 1950. This was the first discovery in the Grants Uranium District , and led to a uranium boom that lasted almost 30 years. The San Juan Basin yielded 60% of the uranium in the United States, valued at over $25 billion.

Martinez's discovery, in 1950 on Santa Fe Railroad land, was developed into the Haystack mine. He was hired by the railroad and Anaconda Mining Company as a uranium scout for $400 per month, a good salary then. Following the discovery, the town of Grants became a yellowcake boomtown ; its population grew from 2,200 to 50,000 within a few months. The mining boom lasted for decades, until the 1980s when it collapsed. The Santa Fe Railroad continued to pay Martinez $250 per month until the day he died.

After his first discovery, in 1950 of carnotite , a low-grade uranium-bearing ore, he staked a claim on 160 acres (65 ha). After that he explored Haystack Mountain where he made the discovery of high-grade ore. He became nationally known for his discovery.

Martinez was born in the village of Pinedale, New Mexico . He and his wife Mary had 14 children.

Martinez, a Navajo of Mexican descent, and a native New Mexican, became famous for his discovery. He was the subject of feature articles in Time , Life , True West and Reader's Digest magazines. Martinez was fluent in the Navajo , Laguna ( Keresan ), Spanish and English languages. He was a medicine man and a leader in his community.

Martinez also worked as a law officer on the Navajo reservation , ran a mountain sheep camp and worked as a labor recruiter for carrot farms.

His tombstone at Grants Memorial Cemetery simply reads, "Paddy Martinez 1881 - 1969 Uranium Pioneer." His grave is nearby Paddy Martinez Park, where children play.

Martinez was inducted into the National Mining Hall of Fame in 1992.
