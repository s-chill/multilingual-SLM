Fish marketing is the marketing and sale of fish products .

The live fish trade can refer to the live food fish trade (for human consumption) or to the ornamental fish trade (for aquariums ).  The fish can come from many places, but most comes from Southeast Asia .

A fish market is a marketplace for selling fish and fish products . It can be dedicated to wholesale trade between fishermen and fish merchants , or to the sale of seafood to individual consumers, or to both. Retail fish markets, a type of wet market , often sell street food as well.

Fish markets range in size from small fish stalls to large ones such as the great Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, which turns over about 660,000 tonnes a year.

The fundamental meaning of un chasse-mar√©e was "a wholesale fishmonger", originally on the Channel coast of France and later, on the Atlantic coast as well. He bought in the coastal ports and sold in inland markets. However, this meaning is not normally adopted into English . The name for such a trader in Britain, from 1500 to 1900 at least, was 'rippier'.
