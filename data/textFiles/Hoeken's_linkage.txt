In kinematics , the Hoecken linkage (named for Karl Hoecken ) is a four-bar linkage that converts rotational motion to approximate straight-line motion . The Hoecken linkage is a cognate linkage of the Chebyshev linkage and Chebyshev's Lambda Mechanism .

The linkage was first published in 1926.

A generalization of the Hoecken linkage is Wittgenstein's rod .
