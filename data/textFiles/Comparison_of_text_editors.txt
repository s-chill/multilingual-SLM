This article provides basic comparisons for notable text editors . More feature details for text editors are available from the Category of text editor features and from the individual products' articles. This article may not be up-to-date or necessarily all-inclusive.

Feature comparisons are made between stable versions of software, not the upcoming versions or beta releases â€“ and are exclusive of any add-ons, extensions or external programs (unless specified in footnotes).

This section lists the operating systems that different editors can run on. Some editors run on additional operating systems that are not listed.

Large file support:

In general, most text editors do not support large text files. Some restrict themselves to available in-core RAM while others use sophisticated virtual memory management techniques and paging algorithms.

Search in files: Perform search (and possibly replace) in multiple files on disk, for example on a sub-directory and recursively all the directories below it.
Similar to grep .

Support for custom key bindings .

Support for editing files over a network or the Internet.

To support specified character encoding, the editor must be able to load, save, view and edit text in the specific encoding and not destroy any characters. For UTF-8 and UTF-16, this requires internal 16-bit character support.

Partial support is indicated if: 1) the editor can only convert the character encoding to internal (8-bit) format for editing.
2) If some encodings are supported only in some platforms .
3) If the editor can only display specific character set (such as OEM) by loading corresponding font, but does not support keyboard entry for that character set.

Support for Right-To-Left (RTL) texts is necessary for editing some languages like Arabic , Persian , Hebrew , and Yiddish and the mixture of left to right (LTR) and RTL known as bi-directional ( BiDi ) support.

Depending on the algorithm used in the programs it might only render the bidirectional text correctly but may not be able to edit them. (e.g. Notepad++ 5.1.3 shows bidirectional texts correctly but cannot edit it and user should change the text direction to RTL to be able to edit RTL texts correctly.)
