Asio is a freely available, open-source , cross-platform C++ library for network programming .  It provides developers with a consistent asynchronous I/O model using a modern C++ approach. Boost.Asio was accepted into the Boost library on 30 December 2005 after a 20-day review .  The library has been developed by Christopher M. Kohlhoff since 2003. A networking proposal based on Asio was submitted to the C++ standards committee in 2006 for possible inclusion in the second Technical Report on C++ Library Extensions ( TR2 ).

As of 2024, Asio continues to evolve, with ongoing contributions from the community and enhancements to its functionality. The library is regularly updated to support the latest C++ standards and best practices in network programming. Developers are encouraged to explore the extensive documentation and tutorials available on the official Asio website, which cover a wide range of topics, from basic usage to advanced features.
