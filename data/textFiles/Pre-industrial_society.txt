Pre-industrial refers to a time before there were machines and tools to help perform tasks en masse . Pre-industrial civilization dates back to centuries ago, but the main era known as the pre-industrial society occurred right before the industrial society . Pre-Industrial societies vary from region to region depending on the culture of a given area or history of social and political life. Europe was known for its feudal system and the Italian Renaissance .

The term "pre-industrial" is also used as a benchmark for environmental conditions before the development of industrial society: for example, the Paris Agreement , adopted in Paris on 12 December, 2015 and in force from 4 November, 2016, "aims to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees celsius , compared to pre-industrial levels." The date for the end of the "pre-industrial era" is not defined.
