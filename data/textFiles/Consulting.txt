Once a business owner defines the needs to take a business to the next level, a decision maker will define the scope, cost and the time frame of the project. The role of the IT consultancy company is to support and nurture the company from the very beginning of the project until the end, and deliver the project not only in the scope, time and cost but also with complete customer satisfaction.
