Regional rail is a term used for passenger rail services that operate between towns and cities.  These trains operate with more stops than inter-city rail , and unlike commuter rail , operate beyond the limits of urban areas , connecting smaller cities and towns.

In North America, "regional rail" is often used as a synonym for "commuter rail", often using "commuter rail" to refer to systems that primarily or only offer service during the rush hour while using "regional rail" to refer to systems that offer all-day service.

Regional rail is usually defined as providing services that link settlements to each other, unlike commuter rail which links locations within a singular urban area. Unlike inter-city services, regional trains stop at more stations and serve smaller communities. They may share routes with inter-city services, providing service to settlements that inter-city trains skip, or be the sole service on routes not busy enough to justify inter-city service.

Regional rail services are much less likely to be profitable than inter-city (mainly because many passengers use monthly passes giving a lower price per ride, and that lower average speed gives less distance, meaning less ticket revenue per hour of operation) and hence require government funding. This is justified on social or environmental grounds, and because regional rail services often act as feeders for more profitable inter-city lines.

There are also services that are something in between regional and inter-city, like the Oresundtrain (between Copenhagen and three cities in Sweden over 3 hours away) with stopping pattern like a regional train and pass prices attracting work commuters.
