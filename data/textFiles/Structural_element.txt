In structural engineering , structural elements are used in structural analysis to split a complex structure into simple elements (each bearing a structural load ). Within a structure, an element cannot be broken down (decomposed) into parts of different kinds (e.g., beam or column).

Structural elements can be lines, surfaces or volumes.
