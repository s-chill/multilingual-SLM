Mobile Autonomous Robot Vehicle for Indoor Navigation ( Marvin ) is a mobile robot developed at Robotics Lab at University of Kaiserslautern , Germany .
This platform consists of a differential drive, a bumper for basic operational safety, planar laser range scanners at the front and back side for obstacle detection, a belt of ultrasonic sensors for recognizing jutting edges such as table tops, a web cam , another fixed laser scanner at a height of one meter for a view free of clutter and a stereo microphone system for localization of sound sources. Its control system follows a behavior-based approach and its mapping abilities rely on a 2D geometric and topological strategy.
