In cryptography , impossible differential cryptanalysis is a form of differential cryptanalysis for block ciphers . While ordinary differential cryptanalysis tracks differences that propagate through the cipher with greater than expected probability , impossible differential cryptanalysis exploits differences that are impossible (having probability 0) at some intermediate state of the cipher algorithm.

Lars Knudsen appears to be the first to use a form of this attack, in the 1998 paper where he introduced his AES candidate , DEAL . The first presentation to attract the attention of the cryptographic community was later the same year at the rump session of CRYPTO '98, in which Eli Biham , Alex Biryukov , and Adi Shamir introduced the name "impossible differential" and used the technique to break 4.5 out of 8.5 rounds of IDEA and 31 out of 32 rounds of the NSA -designed cipher Skipjack . This development led cryptographer Bruce Schneier to speculate that the NSA had no previous knowledge of impossible differential cryptanalysis. The technique has since been applied to many other ciphers: Khufu and Khafre , E2 , variants of Serpent , MARS , Twofish , Rijndael (AES), CRYPTON , Zodiac , Hierocrypt-3 , TEA , XTEA , Mini-AES , ARIA , Camellia , and SHACAL-2 .

Biham, Biryukov and Shamir also presented a relatively efficient specialized method for finding impossible differentials that they called a miss-in-the-middle attack. This consists of finding "two events with probability one, whose conditions cannot be met together."
