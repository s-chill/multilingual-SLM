A referendum on extending the operation of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant was held in Lithuania on 12 October 2008 alongside parliamentary elections . The country's government was obliged to close down Ignalina as part of its treaty of accession to the European Union .

The electorate were asked to vote on the statement: "I approve of the extension of operation of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant for a technically safe period, but not longer than completion of the construction of a new nuclear power plant."

Although 91.4% of voters voted in favour of continuing the plant's operation, voter turnout was below the 50% threshold required to make the results valid.
