An escape pod , escape capsule , life capsule , or lifepod is a capsule or craft, usually only big enough for one person, used to escape from a vessel in an emergency. An escape ship is a larger, more complete craft also used for the same purpose. Escape pods are ubiquitous in science fiction but are only used in a few real vehicles.

Escape pods are frequently depicted as being used by large spacecraft in science fiction, for example the Millennium Falcon in Star Wars , the Axiom in WALL-E , and the vessels of Starfleet in Star Trek . The 1981 film Lifepod and the 1993 TV film of the same name both revolve around such vehicles.
