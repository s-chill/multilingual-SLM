An oyster schooner is a type of traditional fishing boat specifically designed for the harvesting of oysters .  Typically, an oyster schooner was a gaff-rigged two-masted schooner akin to the Dorchester schooner.  They were used in the past in Delaware Bay until a blight killed most of the oysters in that area.  A surviving example is the A.J. Meerwald located in Bivalve, New Jersey .
