In cryptography , NUSH is a block cipher invented by Anatoly Lebedev and Alexey Volchkov for the Russian company LAN Crypto . It was submitted to the NESSIE project, but was not selected.

NUSH exists in several different variants, using keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits, and a block size of 64, 128, or 256 bits. The number of rounds is 9, 17, or 33, depending on the block size. The algorithm uses key whitening , but no S-boxes ; the only operations it uses are AND , OR , XOR , modular addition , and bit rotation .

It has been shown that linear cryptanalysis can break NUSH with less effort than a brute force attack .
