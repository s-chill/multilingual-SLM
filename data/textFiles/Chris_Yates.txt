Chris Yates is an angler , photographer, broadcaster, tea connoisseur and author born on 19 April 1948. He is a former holder of the record for the heaviest-recorded British carp , a 51lb 6oz specimen captured from Redmire pool in 1980. Yates is a former co-editor (with Jon Ward-Allen) of Waterlog magazine, and is a regular contributor to The Idler .

Yates prefers vintage tackle , particularly split-cane rods and centrepin reels , and regards cane as superior to any other rod-making material. His books and films emphasise being close to nature as one of the principal pleasures of fishing.

Yates was one of two central characters in BBC2 's 1993 TV series A Passion for Angling , made by Hugh Miles and also featuring Bob James, in which the pair go fishing for carp, salmon and other species across Britain . The series was shown in many countries including Mexico, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Italy, Norway and Japan.

Between 1996 and 2006 Yates presented numerous BBC radio documentaries, all produced by Dan Shepherd of Far Shoreline Productions . They included 'Fishing for Doubters', 'The Case of the Missing Burbot', 'Nocturne' and 'Fish Tales' . In 2020 Yates presented 'Reading the Water' and in 2022 'Reading the Air' , both for BBC Radio 4.
