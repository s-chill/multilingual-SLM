Virtual intelligence ( VI ) is the term given to artificial intelligence that exists within a virtual world . Many virtual worlds have options for persistent avatars that provide information, training, role-playing, and social interactions.

The immersion of virtual worlds provides a platform for VI beyond the traditional paradigm of past user interfaces (UIs). What Alan Turing established as the benchmark for telling the difference between human and computerized intelligence was done void of visual influences. With today's VI bots, virtual intelligence has evolved past the constraints of past testing into a new level of the machine's ability to demonstrate intelligence. The immersive features of these environments provide nonverbal elements that affect the realism provided by virtually intelligent agents.

Virtual intelligence is the intersection of these two technologies:
