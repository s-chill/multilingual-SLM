The following is a list of Hello, world! programs.

Hello, world! programs make the text "Hello, world!" appear on a computer screen. It is usually the first program encountered when learning a programming language. Otherwise, it's a basic sanity check for an installation of a new programming language. If "Hello World" does not run, one must not try to develop complex programs before fixing the issues with the installation.

For even more languages have a look at the Hello World Collection .

It should be noted that the 4DOS/4NT batch language is a superset of the MS-DOS batch language.

The example below makes use of the singleton pattern and outputs the text in a message box instead of a classic list output.

This will output to the output window only, which an end user would not see.

This version will be visible to the end user.

The ALGOL 68 standard requires that reserved-words , types and operators are in a different typeface.
Hence programs are typically published in either bold or an underline typeface, e.g.:

In the popular upper-case stropping convention for bold words:

or using a wikitext like quote stropping, this is especially suitable on computers with only 6 bits per character (hence only have UPPERCASE):

or minimally using the "brief symbol" form of begin and end .

This program sends the message out via the Diagnostics Interface after start-up.

When the function is executed by typing its name the APL interpreter assigns the text vector to the variable R, but since we have not used this value in another function, primitive, or assignment statement the interpreter returns it to the terminal, thus displaying the words on the next line below the function invocation.

The session would look like this

While not a program, if you simply supplied the text vector to the interpreter but did not assign it to a variable it would return it to the terminal as output.  Note that user input is automatically indented 6 spaces by the interpreter while results are displayed at the beginning of a new line.

Example of making 32-bit PE program as raw code and data:

Using FASM import macro, unicode (MessageBoxW is one of few unicode functions 'supported' by Windows 9x/ME) and section sharing, no relocation (not required for 32-bit Windows NT executables, recommended for DOS-based Windows, required for x64), no heap - Not a beginners example but only 1024 instead of 3072 bytes:

or the even smaller version (from qUE);

(The comma after the command name is optional.)

This is the first known Hello, world! program ever written: [1]

The following example works for any ANSI/ISO-compliant BASIC implementation, as well as most implementations built into or distributed with microcomputers in the 1970s and 1980s (usually some variant of Microsoft BASIC):

Note that the "END" statement is optional in many implementations of BASIC.

Some implementations could also execute instructions in an immediate mode when line numbers are omitted.  The following examples work without requiring a RUN instruction.

Later implementations of BASIC allowed greater support for structured programming and did not require line numbers for source code.  The following example works when RUN for the vast majority of modern BASICs.

Again, the "END" statement is optional in many BASICs.

This also works on Python 2.4 or later, but in an unintuitive way. In Python 3, it calls the print function with the string "Hello, world!" . In Python 2, it executes the print statement with the expression ("Hello, world!") , which evaluates to the string "Hello, world!" .

In Python 2.6 or later:

Note that the previous example will only work when the code is entered as part of a Form Load Event, such as the one created by default when generating a new project in the Visual Studio programming environment.

This page shows the Hello, world! program in esoteric programming languages — that is, working programming languages that were designed as experiments or jokes and were not intended for serious use.
