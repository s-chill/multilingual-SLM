A water taxi or a water bus is a boat used to provide public or private transport , usually, but not always, in an urban environment . Service may be scheduled with multiple stops, operating in a similar manner to a bus , or on demand to many locations, operating in a similar manner to a taxi . A boat service shuttling between two points would normally be described as a ferry rather than a water bus or taxi.

The term water taxi is usually confined to a boat operating on demand, and water bus to a boat operating on a schedule. In North American usage, the terms are roughly synonymous.

The earliest water taxi service was recorded as operating around the area that became Manchester , England.

Cities and other places operating water buses and/or taxis include:

On demand water taxis are also commonly found in marinas , harbours and cottage areas, providing access to boats and waterfront properties that are not directly accessible by land.

On March 6, 2004, a water taxi on the Seaport Taxi service operated by the Living Classrooms Foundation capsized during a storm on the Patapsco River , near Baltimore's Inner Harbor . A total of five passengers died in the accident, which the National Transportation Safety Board determined was caused by insufficient stability when the small pontoon-style vessel encountered strong winds and waves. The company no longer operates water taxi vessels in Baltimore harbor.
