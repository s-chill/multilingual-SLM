Fuzzy classification is the process of grouping elements into fuzzy sets whose membership functions are defined by the truth value of a fuzzy propositional function . A fuzzy propositional function is analogous to an expression containing one or more variables, such that when values are assigned to these variables, the expression becomes a fuzzy proposition .

Accordingly, fuzzy classification is the process of grouping individuals having the same characteristics into a fuzzy set . A fuzzy classification corresponds to a membership function μ C ~ : P F ~ × U → T ~ {\textstyle \mu _{\tilde {C}}:{\tilde {PF}}\times U\to {\tilde {T}}} that indicates the degree to which an individual i ∈ U {\textstyle i\in U} is a member of the fuzzy class C ~ {\textstyle {\tilde {C}}} , given its fuzzy classification predicate Π ~ C ~ ∈ P F ~ {\textstyle {\tilde {\Pi }}_{\tilde {C}}\in {\tilde {PF}}} . Here, T ~ {\textstyle {\tilde {T}}} is the set of fuzzy truth values , i.e., the unit interval [ 0 , 1 ] {\textstyle [0,1]} . The fuzzy classification predicate Π ~ C ~ ( i ) {\textstyle {\tilde {\Pi }}_{\tilde {C}}(i)} corresponds to the fuzzy restriction " i {\textstyle i} is a member of C ~ {\textstyle {\tilde {C}}} ".

Intuitively, a class is a set that is defined by a certain property, and all objects having that property are elements of that class. The process of classification evaluates for a given set of objects whether they fulfill the classification property, and consequentially are a member of the corresponding class. However, this intuitive concept has some logical subtleties that need clarification.

A class logic is a logical system which supports set construction using logical predicates with the class operator { ⋅ | ⋅ } {\textstyle \{\cdot |\cdot \}} . A class

C = { i | Π ( i ) } {\displaystyle C=\{i|\Pi (i)\}}

is defined as a set C of individuals i satisfying a classification predicate Π which is a propositional function. The domain of the class operator { .| .}  is the set of variables V and the set of propositional functions PF, and the range is the powerset of this universe P(U) that is, the set of possible subsets:

{ ⋅ | ⋅ } : V × P F → P ( U ) {\displaystyle \{\cdot |\cdot \}:V\times PF\rightarrow P(U)}

Here is an explanation of the logical elements that constitute this definition:

In contrast, classification is the process of grouping individuals having the same characteristics into a set. A classification corresponds to a membership function μ that indicates whether an individual is a member of a class, given its classification predicate Π.

μ : P F × U → T {\displaystyle \mu :PF\times U\rightarrow T}

The membership function maps from the set of propositional functions PF and the universe of discourse U into the set of truth values T. The membership μ of individual i in Class C is defined by the truth value τ of the classification predicate Π.

μ C ( i ) := τ ( Π ( i ) ) {\displaystyle \mu C(i):=\tau (\Pi (i))}

In classical logic the truth values are certain. Therefore a classification is crisp, since the truth values are either exactly true or exactly false.
