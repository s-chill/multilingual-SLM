The eight U.S. regional fishery management councils are the primary forums for developing conservation and management measures for U.S. marine fisheries . The regional councils recommend management measures for fisheries in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) ; which are subject to approval and implemented by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) .  The councils were established by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1976. In 1996, revisions to the laws governing the regional fishery management councils were made by the Sustainable Fisheries Act , which includes provisions to reduce bycatch , consider the effects of management decisions on communities, and protect essential fish habitats.

The councils are composed of individuals with a stake in the fishery.  This includes federal and state officials, primarily from the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service .  Additionally, councils have at-large and obligatory members selected by state governors to represent non-government stakeholders and special interests such as commercial fishermen, fisheries scientists, and charter boat owners.
