Free energy suppression (or new energy suppression ) is a conspiracy theory that technologically viable, pollution-free, no-cost energy sources are being suppressed by governments, corporations, or advocacy groups . Devices allegedly suppressed include perpetual motion machines, cold fusion generators, torus -based generators, reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology , anti-gravity propulsion systems, and other generally unproven, low-cost energy sources.

The alleged suppression (or weakening) is claimed to have occurred since the mid-19th century and allegedly perpetrated by various government agencies, corporate powers, special interest groups , and fraudulent inventors. The special interest groups are usually claimed to be associated with the fossil fuel or nuclear industry , whose business model would be threatened.

Claims of suppression include:

Some notable people who have been claimed to be suppressed, harassed, or killed for their research are Stanley Meyer , Eugene Mallove , and Nikola Tesla . Free energy proponents claim that Tesla developed a system (the Wardenclyffe Tower ) that could generate unlimited energy for free. However, his system was only intended to transmit energy for free; the system's energy would still need to be generated through conventional means.

Notable proponents of the conspiracy theory include Gary McKinnon , a Scottish computer hacker who unlawfully accessed computer systems to look for evidence of a secret free energy device.

Followers of the Tartaria conspiracy theory believe an advanced civilization called Tartaria destroyed by a "mud flood" now covered up by the world's governments once had free wireless energy.
