The Apple Campus is the former corporate headquarters of Apple Inc. from 1993 until 2017. In April 2017, it was largely replaced by Apple Park (aka Apple Campus 2), but is still an Apple office and lab space. The campus is located at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, California , United States. Its design resembles that of a university, with the buildings arranged around green spaces .

Apple's corporate headquarters was originally located at Building 1 on 20525 Mariani Ave in Cupertino. The land east of Mariani One across De Anza Boulevard where the campus was built was originally occupied by the company Four-Phase Systems (later acquired by Motorola ). Its area is 850,000 square feet (79,000 m ). Construction began in 1992 and was completed in 1993 by the Sobrato Development Company. Before 1997, activities on the campus were exclusively research and development . Until then, the buildings were referred to as R&D 1–6. With the return of Steve Jobs to Apple in 1997, changes were made to the campus. Apple increased the number of occupied buildings, and many activities not related to R&D were moved to the buildings on Infinite Loop, gaining "IL" designations. Steve Jobs's actions included banning employees' pets and dramatically improving the cafeteria menu.

On the night of August 12, 2008, a fire started on the second floor of the building Valley Green 6. The firefighters worked until morning to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, but the forty-year-old building suffered $2 million of fire damage.

The Apple Campus is located on the southeast corner of Interstate 280 and De Anza Boulevard, and occupies 32 acres (130,000 m ) in six buildings spread over four floors. Each building is numbered with one digit on the private U-shaped street Infinite Loop, so named because of the programming concept of an infinite loop . The street, in conjunction with Mariani Avenue, actually does form a circuit (or cycle) that can circulate indefinitely. The main building has the address 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California. Employees refer to these buildings as IL1 to IL6 for Infinite Loop 1–6. Beyond Infinite Loop, the whole Apple Campus occupies an additional thirty buildings scattered throughout the city.

Some of these buildings are leased (with an average rental cost of $2.50 per square foot), and others are of recent acquisition; the land that the new buildings occupy is for future construction of a second campus in the city for centralization. In total, including nine newly acquired buildings on Pruneridge Avenue, the company controls more than 3,300,000 square feet (310,000 m ) for its activities in the city of Cupertino. This represents almost 40% of the 8,800,000 square feet (820,000 m ) of office space and facilities for research and development available in the city.

At 1 Infinite Loop was an Apple Store selling Apple equipment and souvenirs. It was the only part of the campus open to the public. The store was closed on January 20, 2024, at 6:00pm.
