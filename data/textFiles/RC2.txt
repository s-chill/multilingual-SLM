In cryptography , RC2 (also known as ARC2 ) is a symmetric-key block cipher designed by Ron Rivest in 1987.  "RC" stands for "Ron's Code" or "Rivest Cipher"; other ciphers designed by Rivest include RC4 , RC5 , and RC6 .

The development of RC2 was sponsored by Lotus , who were seeking a custom cipher that, after evaluation by the NSA , could be exported as part of their Lotus Notes software. The NSA suggested a few changes, which Rivest incorporated. After further negotiations, the cipher was approved for export in 1989. Along with RC4, RC2 with a 40-bit key size was treated favourably under US export regulations for cryptography .

Initially, the details of the algorithm were kept secret — proprietary to RSA Security — but on 29 January 1996, source code for RC2 was anonymously posted to the Internet on the Usenet forum sci.crypt . Mentions of CodeView and SoftICE (popular debuggers ) suggest that it had been reverse engineered . A similar disclosure had occurred earlier with RC4.

In March 1998, Ron Rivest authored an RFC publicly describing RC2 himself.

RC2 is a 64-bit block cipher with a variable size key . Its 18 rounds are arranged as a source-heavy unbalanced Feistel network , with 16 rounds of one type ( MIXING ) punctuated by two rounds of another type ( MASHING ). A MIXING round consists of four applications of the MIX transformation, as shown in the diagram.

RC2 is vulnerable to a related-key attack using 2 chosen plaintexts .
