Ballistic impact is a high velocity impact by a small mass object, analogous to runway debris or small arms fire. The simulation of ballistic impacts can be achieved with a light-gas gun or other ballistic launcher. It is important to study the response of materials to ballistic impact loads. Applications of this research include body armor , armored vehicles and fortified buildings, as well as the protection of essential equipment, such as the jet engines of an airliner .
