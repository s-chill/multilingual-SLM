Feasting on Asphalt is a television series starring Alton Brown of the Food Network programs Good Eats and Iron Chef America .

Brown's third series, Feasting on Asphalt explores "road food" (eating establishments which cater to travelers) in the historical and present-day United States, with an emphasis on unique restaurants and regional cuisine. In the first two seasons, Brown and his crew seek "good eats" across the country, via Brown's BMW motorcycle . "As far as I’m concerned, there’s no better way to experience the road than from the back of a bike," says Brown. During the third season (titled Feasting on Waves ), Brown trades the motorcycle for a boat to island hop throughout the Caribbean with a similar mission.

Season 1 consisted of four episodes, initially broadcast July 29, August 5, August 12, and August 19, 2006 (Shot Spring/Summer '06).  Brown traveled from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, and sampled food along his travel route. The episodes included segments documenting famous journeys and travelers (from the Odyssey to the Crusades , to Lewis and Clark , and Jack Kerouac ), and interviews with many of the restaurant owners and patrons he met en route.

Brown suffered a motorcycle crash during the shooting of the Nevada segment, injuring his right clavicle . This injury was caught on camera and was shown in episode 4.

Brown began his trip in Mount Pleasant, SC , then wound his way through Georgia , South Carolina , North Carolina , Tennessee , Kentucky , Indiana , Missouri , Kansas , Colorado , Utah , Arizona , Nevada and then to the California coast.

Alton Brown is shown wearing a sling for three quarters of this episode after his motorcycle accident in Nevada and resulting shoulder injury. On the sling is written: "If you can read this odds are I'm about to scream." The Chicago Tribune said of the incident that Brown was "surely the only Food Network celeb to have broken bones in a motorcycle crash on camera".

The second season, Feasting on Asphalt 2 – The River Run , began airing August 4, 2007 on the Food Network. The journey began in Venice, Louisiana , with Brown and his crew tracing the Mississippi River north.  According to Brown's website, Feasting on Asphalt 2 was filmed during April and May 2007, and consists of six episodes along the Great River Road . Brown deviates from the Great River Road, however, missing several of the cities that travel along the Mississippi River; rather than following the river through towns such as Grand Rapids, Minnesota, and Bemidji, Minnesota, Brown cuts straight over from Crosby, Minnesota to Itasca State Park in order to reach the source of the Mississippi River .
