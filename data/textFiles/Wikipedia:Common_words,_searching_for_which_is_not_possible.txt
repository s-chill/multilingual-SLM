As of February 2006, the information on this page is no longer correct.   Wikipedia's current Lucene index does not use "stop words", so any word can be successfully used in search queries.

Some words in wikipedia cannot currently be searched for, because they are deemed too common. The following is a full list of those words. They are written as links, so that at least articles with a single common word as title can be found through this list.

If the exact title of an article is known or guessed, the Go button can be used; this feature is not affected by the above-mentioned restriction.

Further articles which are difficult to find otherwise:
