An electric dragbike is an electric motorcycle used for drag racing .

Electric dragsters have come of age with new developments in battery and motor technology. Electric motors powered by lithium cells can deliver power-to-weight ratios similar to high performance gasoline engines . Drag races last around ten seconds so battery range is not an issue. A number of electric dragbikes and dragsters (cars) are competing with Top Fuel classes.  Electric drag racing records are listed at NEDRA .

Electric dragbike tend to use lithium-ion or nickel-metal hydride cells due to their higher energy density which means they are less bulky to carry. In addition fewer cells are needed compared to a car as the "payload" of bike and rider is lighter. Typical weights: 80 kg (176 lb) rider, 200 kg (441 lb) bike excluding battery weight.
