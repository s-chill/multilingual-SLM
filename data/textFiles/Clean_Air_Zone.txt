A Clean Air Zone (CAZ) is an area in the United Kingdom where targeted action is taken to improve air quality . A CAZ can be non-charging or charging.

Whether a vehicle is charged when entering or moving through a CAZ depends on the type of vehicle and the Euro standard of the vehicle. The amount charged is up to the local authority responsible for the CAZ. Ultra-low-emission vehicles are not charged when entering or moving through a Clean Air Zone.
