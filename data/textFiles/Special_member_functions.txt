In the C++ programming language , special member functions are functions which the compiler will automatically generate if they are used, but not declared explicitly by the programmer.
The automatically generated special member functions are:

In these cases the compiler generated versions of these functions perform a memberwise operation. For example, the compiler generated destructor will destroy each sub-object (base class or member) of the object.

The compiler generated functions will be public , non- virtual and the copy constructor and assignment operators will receive const& parameters (and not be of the alternative legal forms ).

The following example depicts two classes: Explicit for which all special member functions are explicitly declared and Implicit for which none are declared.

Here are the signatures of the special member functions:

In C++03 before the introduction of move semantics (in C++11) the special member functions were:
