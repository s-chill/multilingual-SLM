A box cut (box pit) is a small open cut built to supply a secure and safe entrance as access to a slope to an underground mine . Generally the box cut is sunk until sufficiently unweathered rock is found to permit the development of the decline. The portal is generally made safe with rock bolts , wire mesh, and shotcrete , which prevents accidental rock falls from closing access to the decline.
