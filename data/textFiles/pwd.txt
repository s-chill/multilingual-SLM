In Unix-like and some other operating systems , the pwd command ( p rint w orking d irectory ) writes the full pathname of the current working directory to the standard output .

Multics had a pwd command (which was a short name of the print_wdir command) from which the Unix pwd command originated. The command is a shell builtin in most Unix shells such as Bourne shell , ash , bash , ksh , and zsh . It can be implemented easily with the POSIX C functions getcwd() or getwd() .

It is also available in the operating systems SpartaDOS X , PANOS , and KolibriOS . The equivalent on DOS ( COMMAND.COM ) and Microsoft Windows ( cmd.exe ) is the cd command with no arguments. Windows PowerShell provides the equivalent Get-Location cmdlet with the standard aliases gl and pwd .
On Windows CE 5.0 , the cmd.exe Command Processor Shell includes the pwd command.

pwd as found on Unix systems is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification . It appeared in Version 5 Unix . The version of pwd bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Jim Meyering.

The numerical computing environments MATLAB and GNU Octave include a pwd function with similar functionality. The OpenVMS equivalent is show default .

Note: POSIX requires that the default behavior be as if the -L switch were provided.

POSIX shells set the following environment variables while using the cd command:
