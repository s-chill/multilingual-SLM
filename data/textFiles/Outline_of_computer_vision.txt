The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to computer vision:

Computer vision â€“ interdisciplinary field that deals with how computers can be made to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos . From the perspective of engineering , it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do. Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring digital images (through image sensors ), image processing , and image analysis , to reach an understanding of digital images. In general, it deals with the extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information that the computer can interpret. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or multi-dimensional data from a medical scanner. As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images.
