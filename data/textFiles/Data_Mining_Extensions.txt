Data Mining Extensions ( DMX ) is a query language for data mining models supported by Microsoft 's SQL Server Analysis Services product.

Like SQL , it supports a data definition language (DDL), data manipulation language (DML) and a data query language (DQL), all three with SQL-like syntax. Whereas SQL statements operate on relational tables, DMX statements operate on data mining models. Similarly, Microsoft SQL Server supports the MDX language for OLAP databases. DMX is used to create and train data mining models, and to browse, manage, and predict against them. DMX is composed of data definition language (DDL) statements, data manipulation language (DML) statements, and functions and operators.

DMX Queries are formulated using the SELECT statement.
They can extract information from existing data mining models in various ways.
