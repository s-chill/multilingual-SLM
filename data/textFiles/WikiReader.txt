WikiReader was a project to deliver an offline , text-only version of Wikipedia on a mobile device . The project was sponsored by Openmoko and made by Pandigital , and its source code has been released.

The project debuted an offline portable reader for Wikipedia in October 2009. Updates in multiple languages were available online and a twice-yearly offline update service delivered via Micro SD card was also available at a cost of $29 per year. WikiReader versions of the English Wikipedia , Wikiquote , Wiktionary and Project Gutenberg can be installed together on a user-supplied 16Â GB Micro SDHC memory card . Unlike Wikipedia itself, the device features parental controls .

The device can also run programs written in the Forth programming language; a simple calculator program is included.

In late 2014, the WikiReader website and project itself were abandoned, following Pandigital going out of business.

The last official WikiReader image was released in 2011, however unofficial images are still being produced by a Reddit community centered around the WikiReader.

Images can still be generated based on the latest English Wikipedia using the officially released tools.
