Molinux was an operating system based on Ubuntu sponsored by the autonomous community of Castilla-La Mancha and the Fundación Ínsula Barataria.

The name "Molinux" derives from the Spanish word molino , meaning "mill" or "windmill". Each version of Molinux is named after a character from the classic Spanish novel Don Quixote , by Miguel de Cervantes .

Molinux was an initiative begun in 2005 by the government of Castilla-La Mancha  to introduce the Castile-La Mancha community to the forefront of the Information Society. The Molinux project is intended to attack the digital divide by reducing the cost of software and offering an easy-to-use operating system .

The sponsoring regional government's commitment to the open source philosophy is such that they have committed not to impose the use of Molinux. "The advantage is that the software is free to compete with anyone, and the user can choose between using this or any other software."

Molinux 6.2 (codename "Merlín") was launched on 2010-12-24. It was based on Ubuntu 10.10.
