This list compares various energies in joules (J), organized by order of magnitude .

The joule is named after James Prescott Joule . As with every SI unit named for a person, its symbol starts with an upper case letter (J), but when written in full, it follows the rules for capitalisation of a common noun ; i.e., joule becomes capitalised at the beginning of a sentence and in titles but is otherwise in lower case.
