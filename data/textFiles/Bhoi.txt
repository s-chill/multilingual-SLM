The Adan River ( Marathi : अडाण नदी ) is a river in Washim District , Maharashtra , India and a principal tributary of the Painganga River .

The source of the Adan River is in the Washim district of Maharashtra . The Arunavati River meets the Adan River about 13 kilometres before it joins the Painganga River. The river dries up in the summer, leaving only pools towards the end of its course.

Two dams have been built on the Adan; one at its origin near Sonala village and the other near Karanja Lad city, both in Washim District . The river then flows shrubland .

Adan Dam was built in 1977 near Karanja Lad , Washim district around 13 km from where the Adan River meets the Painanga.
