Mass finishing is a group of manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished . The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish , deburr , clean, radius, de-flash , descale , remove rust , polish, brighten, surface harden , prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing , also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing . Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants , cleaners, or abrasives , while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10 minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2 hours for hardened steel .

Mass finishing processes can be configured as either batch systems, in which batches of workpieces are added, run, and removed before the next batch is run, or as continuous systems, in which the workpieces enter at one end and leave at the other end in the finished state. They may also be sequenced, which involves running the workpieces through multiple different mass finishing processes; usually, the finish becomes progressively finer. Due to the random action of the processes, mass finishing is as much an art as it is a science.

Media are designed for four things:

Compounds are added to mass finishing processes to assist in deburring, burnishing, cutting, cleaning, descaling, and inhibiting corrosion . They may be liquids or dry powders. They are usually broken up into four types: deburring and finishing, burnishing, cleaning, and water stabilizing.
