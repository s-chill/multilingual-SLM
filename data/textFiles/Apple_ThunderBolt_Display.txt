The Apple Thunderbolt Display is a 27-inch flat panel computer monitor developed by Apple Inc. and sold from July 2011 to June 2016. Originally priced at $999, it replaced Apple’s 27-inch Cinema Display . For displays it can only connect with computers with a Thunderbolt port (for data it has a Gigabit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ). It is incompatible with most non-Apple computers, along with Macs released before 2011 and the 2012 Mac Pro or the single USB-C Retina MacBook . Devices with Thunderbolt 3 (such as MacBooks released after 2016) using an adaptor will work with the Apple Display.

The Thunderbolt Display was discontinued in June 2016, and replaced by LG UltraFine displays Apple developed with LG on the consumer end, while the Pro Display XDR succeeded it in 2019 as Apple's professional display. In 2022, the Apple Studio Display was released as the first Apple-branded consumer display since its discontinuation.

Like its predecessor, the 27-inch LED Cinema Display , the resolution is 2560×1440 pixels in a 16:9 aspect ratio . Its chassis is made of aluminum and glass, resembling the contemporary ranges of iMac and MacBook Pro unibody designs. The display features a built-in 720p FaceTime HD camera (replacing the iSight in the previous model), microphone, and stereo speaker system with subwoofer (2.1 channel). An octopus cable with Thunderbolt and MagSafe is permanently attached to the back of the display for data and charging MacBooks, respectively. On the rear of the display is a Thunderbolt port, a FireWire 800 port, three USB 2.0 ports, and a Gigabit Ethernet port.

The Thunderbolt port allows for the possibility of daisy chaining Thunderbolt Displays from a supported Mac, or connecting other devices that have Thunderbolt ports, such as external hard drives and video capture devices. In July 2012, Apple began including a MagSafe to MagSafe 2 adaptor in the box.

On June 23, 2016, Apple announced through a statement it was discontinuing the Thunderbolt Display and would exit the stand-alone display market. Apple subsequently worked with LG to design the Thunderbolt 3-enabled UltraFine line, consisting of 21.5-inch (later 24-inch) 4K and 27-inch 5K displays, which were the only displays sold by Apple from 2016 to 2019. In December 2019, Apple released the Pro Display XDR , the first Apple-branded display since the Thunderbolt Display's discontinuation. In March 2022, Apple released the Apple Studio Display , the first Apple-branded consumer display since the Thunderbolt Display's discontinuation, which similarly includes integrated speakers and a webcam.

The Thunderbolt Display drops compatibility with all previous standards, including VGA, DVI, and DisplayPort. It is not compatible with computers that do not have a Thunderbolt port, including pre-2011 Macs and the vast majority of desktop PCs. The 12-inch Retina MacBook and 2012 Mac Pro do not support Thunderbolt. The following Macs support the Thunderbolt Display without an adapter:

Macs released after 2016 with Thunderbolt 3 and later, which uses a USB-C connector, are compatible using Apple's Thunderbolt 3-to-2 adapter.
