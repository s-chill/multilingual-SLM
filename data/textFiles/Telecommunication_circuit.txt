A telecommunication circuit is a path in a telecommunications network used to transmit information . Circuits have evolved from generally being built on physical connections between individual hardware cables, as in an analog phone switch, to virtual circuits established over packet switching networks.

A telecommunication circuit may be defined as follows:

In operational terms, a telecommunication circuit may be capable of transmitting information in only one direction ( simplex circuit), or it may be bi-directional ( duplex circuit). Bi-directional circuits may support half- duplex operation , when only one end of the channel transmits at any one time, or they may support full-duplex operation, when independent simultaneous transmission occurs in both directions.

Originally, telecommunication circuits transmitted analog signals . Radio stations used them as studio transmitter links (STLs) or as remote pickup unit (RPU) for sound reproduction , sometimes as a backup to other means.  Later lines were digital , used in pair-gain applications, such as carrier systems , or in enterprise data networks .

A leased line , private circuit , or dedicated circuit , is a circuit that is dedicated to only one use and is typically not switched at a central office. The opposite is a switched circuit , which can be connected to different paths in a switching center or telephone exchange. Plain old telephone service (POTS) and ISDN telephone lines are switched circuits.

On certain packet switching telecommunication circuits, a virtual circuit may be created, while sharing the physical circuit.
