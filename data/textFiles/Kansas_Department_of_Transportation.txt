The Kansas Department of Transportation ( KDOT ) is a state government organization in charge of maintaining public roadways of the U.S. state of Kansas .

Since 2012, over $2 billion has been diverted from its coffers to the Kansas general fund and state agencies, earning it the nickname "the bank of KDOT", and jeopardizing the agency's ability to maintain roads in the state.
