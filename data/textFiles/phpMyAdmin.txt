phpMyAdmin is a free and open source administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB . As a portable web application written primarily in PHP , it has become one of the most popular MySQL administration tools, especially for web hosting services .

Tobias Ratschiller, then an IT consultant and later founder of the software company Maguma, started to work on a PHP-based web front-end to MySQL in 1998, inspired by MySQL-Webadmin. He gave up the project (and phpAdsNew , of which he was also the original author) in 2000 because of lack of time.

By that time, phpMyAdmin had already become one of the most popular PHP applications and MySQL administration tools, with a large community of users and contributors. In order to coordinate the growing number of patches , a group of three developers (Olivier Müller, Marc Delisle and Loïc Chapeaux) registered The phpMyAdmin Project at SourceForge and took over the development in 2001.
