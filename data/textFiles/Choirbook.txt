A choirbook is a large format manuscript used by choirs in churches or cathedrals during the Middle Ages and Renaissance . The book is large enough for the entire choir to read from one book. Choirbooks were generally put on a stand with the smaller boy sopranos in front and the men in back. As the printing of music became easier and paper replaced vellum , choirbooks fell out of favour, replaced by smaller, cheaper, and easier to handle partbooks and octavos.

A choirbook was a major investment. Many of them were stark and utilitarian and show signs of heavy and constant use. At larger cathedrals, choirbooks were sometimes lavishly decorated and illuminated . Since they represent an important expense, they were rarely owned by single people, but rather by families or institutions.
