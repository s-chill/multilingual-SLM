A bokkura ( Dhivehi : ބޮއްކުރާ) is the smallest type of boat commonly used in Maldives . It has slight similarities to a dhoni , but is smaller in size, holding just two or three individuals, and without lateen sails. A bokkura usually has a set of oars , and was traditionally used for fishing near reefs or to commute between the shore and anchored fishing or trading vessels especially before there were any jetties on the Maldives.
