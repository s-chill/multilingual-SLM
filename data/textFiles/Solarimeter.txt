A solarimeter is a pyranometer , a type of measuring device used to measure combined direct and diffuse solar radiation . An integrating solarimeter measures energy developed from solar radiation based on the absorption of heat by a black body . The principle this instrument was designed on was first developed by the Italian priest, Father Angelo Bellani . He invented the actinometric method which is based on physical and chemical techniques.
