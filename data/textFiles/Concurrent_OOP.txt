Concurrent object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm which combines object-oriented programming (OOP) together with concurrency . While numerous programming languages, such as Java , combine OOP with concurrency mechanisms like threads , the phrase "concurrent object-oriented programming" primarily refers to systems where objects themselves are a concurrency primitive, such as when objects are combined with the actor model .
