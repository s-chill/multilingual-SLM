Software Development Times , better known as SD Times , is a magazine published by D2 Emerge, in both a print version and an on-line electronic edition.

It has been published since 2000. The first issue appeared in February 2000. The headquarters is in Melville, New York . Since 2003, it has published an annual award list, the " SD Times 100", which honors the top 100 leaders and innovators in the software development industry, as judged by SD Times' editors.

Starting in January 2011, SD Times switched from a bi-monthly to monthly circulation. In July 2017, BZ Media sold SD Times to D2 Emerge, co-founded by then publisher David Lyman and long-time editor-in-chief David Rubenstein.

Christina Cardoza was named SD Times' news editor in December 2017 by D2Emerge.
