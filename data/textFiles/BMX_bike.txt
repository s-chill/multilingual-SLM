A BMX bike is a bicycle used for road cycle sport , specifically racing or stunt riding . BMX stands for bicycle motocross .

Though originally denoting a bicycle intended for BMX racing , the term "BMX bike" is now used as a generic term to encompass race bikes ('class' and 'cruiser') and those used for freestyle disciplines (street, vert, park, flatland), and dedicated dirt jumper bicycles. Frames are made of various types of steel , aluminum , or carbon fiber.

Cheaper, low-end bikes are usually made of steel. Higher range freestyle bikes are mostly chromoly , such as lightweight 4130 chromoly, or generation 3 chromoly.

Generally, rear brakes are available only in racing BMX.
