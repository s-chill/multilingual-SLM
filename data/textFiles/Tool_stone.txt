In archaeology , a tool stone is a type of stone that is used to manufacture stone tools , or tools that use stone as raw material.

Generally speaking, tools that require a sharp edge are made using cryptocrystalline materials that fracture in an easily controlled conchoidal manner. Cryptocrystalline tool stones include flint and chert , which are fine-grained sedimentary materials; rhyolite and felsite , which are igneous flowstones ; and obsidian , a form of natural glass created by igneous processes. These materials fracture in a predictable fashion, and are easily resharpened. For more information on this subject, see lithic reduction .

Large-grained materials such as basalt , granite and sandstone may also be used as tool stones, but for a very different purpose: they are ideal for ground stone artifacts . Whereas cryptocrystalline materials are most useful for killing and processing animals, large-grained materials are usually used for processing plant matter. Their rough faces often make excellent surfaces for grinding plant seeds. With much effort, some large-grained stones may be ground down into awls , adzes , and axes .
