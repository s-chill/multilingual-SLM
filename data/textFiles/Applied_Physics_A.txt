Applied Physics A: Materials Science and Processing is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that is published monthly by Springer Science+Business Media . The editor-in-chief is Thomas Lippert ( Paul Scherrer Institute ). This publication is complemented by Applied Physics B (Lasers & Optics) .

The journal Applied Physics was originally conceived and founded in 1972 by Helmut K.V. Lotsch at Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York. Lotsch edited the journal up to volume 25 and split it thereafter into the two part A 26(Solids and Surfaces) and B 26(Photophysics and Laser Chemistry). He continued his editorship up to the volumes A 61 and B 61. Starting in 1995 the two journals were continued under separate editorships.

Applied Physics A journal covers theoretical and experimental research in applied physics , including surfaces, thin films , the condensed phase of materials, nanostructured materials, application of nanotechnology , and techniques pertaining to advanced processing and characterization. Coverage also includes characterizing materials, evaluating materials, optical & electronic materials, production engineering, process engineering, interfaces (surfaces & thin films), corrosion , and finally coatings.

Publishing formats include articles pertaining to original research, reviews, and rapid communications. Invited papers are also included on a regular basis and collected in special issues.
