The Free Software Foundation of India ( FSFI ) is the Indian sister organisation to the US-based Free Software Foundation . It was founded in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) (the capital of Kerala ) in 2001 as a non-profit Company . The FSFI advocates to promote the use and development of free software in India . This includes educating people about free software , including how it can help the economy of a developing country like India . FSF India regards non-free software as not a solution, but a problem to be solved.  Free software is sometimes locally called swatantra software in India.

In 2003, after meeting with FSF founder Richard Stallman , the President of India Dr. Abdul Kalam urged Indian computer scientists and professionals to use free and open-source software in research and development.

The left side of the FSF India logo resembles the famed Ashoka Chakra , that also appears on the Indian national flag , while its right half is a depiction of a compact disc . The combination of both symbols is intended to draw attention to the similarity between political freedom and free software , the latter of which the FSF promotes.

The Ashoka Chakra , in addition to being a long-standing Buddhist symbol depicting the wheel of time , also resembles Charkha of India's Freedom Struggle and thus in the current context, may symbolize the Indian independence movement which resulted in India's freedom from British occupation.
