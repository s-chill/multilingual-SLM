Thomas Linn Dinwoodie (born November 15, 1954) is a cleantech entrepreneur, inventor, and founder of SunPower Corporation Systems (formerly PowerLight Corporation). He holds a long-standing interest in accelerating the transition to clean energy and other climate-sustaining practices. Dinwoodie is also an architect.

From 1978 to 1983, Dinwoodie was a research assistant at the MIT Energy Laboratory, where he authored numerous papers on the economics and policy of distributed solar and wind generation, as well as flywheel energy storage.

In 1981, Dinwoodie was awarded a contract from the U.S. DOE for development of an ultra-low-cost, polymer solar thermal collector.

He was founder, president and CEO of TDEnergy, a wind power developer in the U.S. Northeast, from 1982 to 1988. TDEnergy constructed one of the earliest New England wind power facilities in Canaan, NH.

Dinwoodie then founded PowerLight Corporation in 1994, and served as its CEO and chairman of the board from 1995 to 2007. PowerLight was a global manufacturer, supplier, and systems integrator of solar products and services for the residential, commercial, and utility sectors. In 2004, PowerLight was inducted into the INC 500 Hall of Fame. PowerLight merged with SunPower Corporation in 2007, where Dinwoodie served as CEO and later CTO for the subsidiary, SunPower Corporation, Systems. SunPower produces high-efficiency solar cells and modules.

Dinwoodie holds over 30 patents on PV-related products.
