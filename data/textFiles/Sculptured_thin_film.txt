Sculptured thin films ( STF s) are nanostructured materials  with unidirectionally varying properties that can be designed and realized in a controllable manner using variants of physical vapor deposition . The ability to virtually instantaneously change the growth direction of their columnar morphology,  through simple variations in  the direction of the incident vapor flux , leads to a wide spectrum of columnar forms.

These forms can be:

The column diameter and the column separation normal to the thickness direction of any STF are nominally constant. The column diameter can range from  about 10 to 300 nm , while the density may lie between its theoretical maximum value to less than 20% thereof. The crystallinity must be at a scale smaller than the column diameter. The chemical composition is essentially unlimited,  ranging from insulators to semiconductors to metals .  Most recently, polymeric STFs have been deposited by combining physical and chemical vapor deposition processes; and deposition on micropatterned substrates has also been carried out.

To date, the chief applications of STFs are in optics as polarization filters, Bragg filters , and spectral hole filters . At visible and infrared wavelengths, a single-section STF is a unidirectionally nonhomogeneous continuum with direction-dependent properties. Several sections can be grown consecutively into a multisection STF, which can be conceived of as an optical circuit that can be integrated with electronic circuitry on a chip . Being porous, an STF can act as a sensor of fluids and can be impregnated with liquid crystals for switching applications too. Applications as low- permittivity barrier layers in electronic chips  as well as solar cells have also been suggested. Biomedical applications such as tissue scaffolds , drug-delivery platforms, virus traps, and labs-on-a-chip are also in different stages of development.
