ikiwiki is a free and open-source wiki application , designed by Joey Hess. It is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License , version 2 or later. ikiwiki is written in Perl , although external plugins can be implemented in any language.

Unlike conventional wiki software, ikiwiki stores its pages in a standard version control system such as Git , Subversion or others.

ikiwiki supports several lightweight markup languages , including Markdown , Creole , reStructuredText and Textile .

In the simplest case, it can function as an off-line static web site generator (possibly still allowing different users to submit changes through VCS; this method is sometimes referred to as wiki compiler ), but it can use CGI to function as a normal web-interfaced wiki as well. Login via OpenID is supported.

ikiwiki can be used for maintaining a blog , and includes common blogging functionality such as comments and RSS feeds. The installer includes an option to set up a simple blog at install time.

ikiwiki is included in various Linux distributions , including Debian and Ubuntu .
