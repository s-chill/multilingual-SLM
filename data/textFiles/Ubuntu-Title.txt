Ubuntu Titling or Ubuntu-Title is a rounded geometric sans-serif font. It was created by Andy Fitzsimon for use with the Ubuntu operating system and its derivatives. It is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License . Prior to the 10.04 release, the typeface was notably used in branding for the Ubuntu operating system and its related projects. Fitzsimon's design was created without any upper-case letters. A later release by Christian Robertson (who later created Roboto ) added capitals and was released by Robertson at the "release candidate" stage. This was called Ubuntu Titling.

Ubuntu Titling was ultimately replaced for branding use with a variant from the Ubuntu Font Family .
