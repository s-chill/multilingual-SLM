The software in this package is not included in Ubuntu by default, as Ubuntu maintainers wish to include only completely free software in out-of-the-box installations. Included packages may be closed-source , encumbered by software patents , or otherwise restricted. For example, the Adobe Flash plugin is a closed-source piece of software. Additionally, many multimedia formats such as MP3 and H.264 are patented. In countries where these patents apply, legally distributing software that use these formats may require paying licensing fees to the patent owners.
