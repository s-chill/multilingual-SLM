The Sound Object (SndObj) Library is a C++ object-oriented programming library for music and audio development. It is composed of 100+ classes for signal processing, audio, MIDI , and file I/O . The library is available for Linux , Windows , Mac OS X , IRIX , and other Unix-like systems.

The library development is now a cooperative project hosted by SourceForge . New versions are released twice-yearly and development versions are available via Concurrent Versions System (CVS).

The Library also provides bindings for Python (aka PySndObj), Java and Common Lisp (through CFFI ).
