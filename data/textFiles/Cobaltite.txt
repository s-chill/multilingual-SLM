Cobaltite is an arsenide and sulfide mineral with the mineral formula Co As S . It is the naming mineral of the cobaltite group of minerals, whose members structurally resemble pyrite (FeS 2 ).

Cobaltite was first described in 1797 by Klaproth It's name stems from the contained element cobalt , whose name is attributed to the German term Kobold , referring to an "underground spirit" or "goblin". The notion of "bewitched" minerals stems from cobaltite and other cobalt ores withstanding the smelting methods of the medieval period, often producing foul-smelling, poisonous fumes in the process.

Cobaltite naturally appears in the form of a tetartoid , a form of dodecahedron with chiral tetrahedral symmetry.

Its impurities may contain up to 10% iron and variable amounts of nickel .

Cobaltite can be separated from other minerals by selective, pH controlled, flotation methods, where cobalt recovery usually involves hydrometallurgy . It can also be processed with pyrometallurgical methods, such as flash smelting.

Although rare, it is mined as a significant source of the strategically important metal cobalt. It occurs in high-temperature hydrothermal deposits and contact metamorphic rocks. It occurs in association with magnetite , sphalerite , chalcopyrite , skutterudite , allanite , zoisite , scapolite , titanite , and calcite along with numerous other Co–Ni sulfides and arsenides. It is found chiefly in Sweden , Norway , Germany , Cornwall, England , Canada , La Cobaltera, Chile, Australia , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Morocco . Crystals have also been found at Khetri in Rajasthan , and under the name sehta the mineral was used by Indian jewellers for producing a blue enamel on gold and silver ornaments.

Secondary weathering incrustations of erythrite , hydrated cobalt arsenate , are common.

A variety containing much iron replacing cobalt, and known as ferrocobaltite ( ‹See Tfd› German: Stahlkobalt ), was found at Siegen in Westphalia .
