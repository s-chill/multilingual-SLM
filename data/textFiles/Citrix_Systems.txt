Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational cloud computing and virtualization technology company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization , networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. Citrix claims that their products are used by over 400,000 clients worldwide, including 99% of the Fortune 100 and 98% of the Fortune 500 .

In 1989, Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas , by Ed Iacobucci , who served as chairman until his departure in 2000. The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems and licensing source code from Microsoft . Citrix has been partnered with Microsoft throughout its history. By the 1990s, Citrix had become an industry leader in thin client technology, enabling purpose-built devices to access remote servers and resources. The company launched its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced significant revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.

Citrix acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity , a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. This was followed by more than a dozen other acquisitions from 2005 to 2012, which allowed Citrix to expand into additional markets including server and desktop virtualization, cloud computing, infrastructure as a service , and software as a service . In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a $1.8 billion deal with LogMeIn , Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity called GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.

Citrix is headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida , with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts and additional development centers in Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. In 2021, Citrix generated $3.2 billion in revenue and had 9,700 employees.

After being acquired by Vista Equity Partners and Evergreen Coast Capital Corp on September 30, 2022, Citrix merged with TIBCO Software under the newly formed Cloud Software Group. Citrix spun off the re-branded Citrix ADC back into a standalone entity called NetScaler under the same parent.

In 1989, Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas , by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding. Following the company's initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home in Coral Springs, Florida . The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM who Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company, and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990. Citrix was originally named Citrus but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights. The name Citrix is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX .

The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser. Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers to remotely access software on a server, even from computers that were not built to run OS/2. Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows . This change made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS . In 1991, the company discussed closing, but investments from Intel , Microsoft, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.

Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users. In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which could run DOS and Windows applications. By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled $10 million.

In 1995, the company then launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft's Windows NT . This new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.

Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995. On its first day of trading, the company's share price doubled from $15 to $30. During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.

After weeks of discussion, Iacobucci persuaded Microsoft to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, resulting in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998. This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible. Citrix also earned $75 million and a royalty arrangement valued at approximately $100 million.

Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best with Citrix's ICA protocol which MetaFrame used. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines that ran Terminal Server Edition.

In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida . It also opened offices in Sydney , London , and Paris that same year.

In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing. That year, Citrix also licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics. In 1999, Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets.

During 1999, Citrix's thin-client model became a software trend, and the company's customers increased to 15 million. Major clients included Sears , AT&T , and Chevron . In 2000, the burst of the dot-com bubble led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to the president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.

In 2001, Citrix acquired Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million. That same year, it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology. MetaFrame XP was later rebranded to Presentation Server, in 2005.

On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time, the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement, the stock hit a five-year low.

In December 2003, Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the company's largest to date. Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist , and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division. In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.

Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies, allowing it to expand into new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery. The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007. Citrix expanded its cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010, with the acquisition of VMLogix. In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer .

In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley . In 2008, the company rebranded its Presentation Server product line to XenApp. Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization. On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce.

Citrix began offering VDI -in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011. The company acquired cloud-based file sharing and storage technology through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.

In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, a maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. This virtualization technology is used in Citrix's XenClient Enterprise edition. Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile. Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise . Zenprise's Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.

In January 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular , where speed and quality may be poor. In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme to bolster its cloud capabilities, such as auto scaling, patching, and automation of complex cloud deployments, for its core business units XenDesktop and Xenapp.

On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated. This was about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million annually. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.

The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminating nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2021, Citrix had approximately 9,700 employees.

Citrix reported a net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013.

In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn , Citrix announced that it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting , GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo. In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion. In July 2017, David Henshall became the company's CEO.

Also in 2017, Citrix expanded its partnership with Google. In May, Google announced that it would add support on its Chrome web browser , including graphics processing unit acceleration, to run Citrix XenApp. In July, the companies announced that they were working to allow Citrix Cloud to deploy virtualized apps and desktops on Google Cloud.

In October 2017, Citrix told regulators of plans to lay off staff "across most functions" and consolidate offices in the fall of 2017 into 2018. The company carried out layoffs in Raleigh, North Carolina , and office closures in Santa Barbara, California , and Tempe, Arizona .

Citrix unveiled its Citrix Analytics security software at the 2017 Citrix Synergy conference in Orlando, Florida , in May 2017. The software detects and responds to security threats using artificial intelligence .

Citrix then unveiled Citrix Analytics for Performance at the 2019 Citrix Summit conference in Orlando, Florida, in May 2019. The software quantifies user experience for Virtual applications and desktop users and also leverages machine learning to troubleshoot performance issues.

In 2018, Citrix changed the names of some of its products to represent its shift to a cloud operating model.
