Space Launch Complex 2 ( SLC-2 ) is an active rocket launch site at Vandenberg Space Force Base , in California , USA . It consists of two launch pads . The East pad ( SLC-2E , originally LC 75-1-1 ) was used for Delta , Thor-Agena and Thorad launches between 1966 and 1972 and has been demolished. The West pad ( SLC-2W , originally LC 75-1-2 ) was used for Delta , Thor-Agena and Delta II launches from 1966 until 2018, when the Delta II performed its last flight.

SLC-2W has been repurposed to launch Firefly Alpha for Firefly Aerospace . During the demolition process, a fire broke out on October 15, 2020, inside the Delta II mobile service tower. The maiden flight of Firefly Alpha took place on September 3, 2021 and resulted in a flight failure. The second flight on 1 October 2022 was successful in reaching orbit.

Space Launch Complex 2 was originally part of Launch Complex 75 ( LC 75 ) and was known by designation LC 75-1 or just 75-1 (and the launch pads were designated LC 75-1-1 and LC 75-1-2). The first launch out of the newly designated Space Launch Complex 2 was that of a Delta E with ESSA-3 on 2 October 1966 from SLC-2E.

SLC-2E and SLC-2W are located approximately 2,000 feet (610Â m) apart.
