A lampara net is a type of fishing net . It is a surrounding net having the shape of a spoon or a dustpan with a short leadline under a longer floatline. The net has a central bunt to contain the fish and two lateral wings.

Lampara nets are used for capturing pelagic fish , those swimming near the water's surface. They are often used in the Mediterranean , the United States , and South Africa to catch sardines . In Argentina they are used for anchoveta and mackerels and in Japan for sea breams and flying fish . They are used in Australia to catch eastern sea garfish ( Hyporhamphus australis ). In South Florida in the US lampara nets are used to catch ballyhoo ( Hemiramphus brasiliensis ) and balao ( H. balao ), which are used as bait fish by anglers . The fishery for opalescent inshore squid ( Doryteuthis opalescens ) in California became successful after Italian immigrants introduced the lampara net there in 1905.

These nets are often utilized on fishing vessels 9 to 18 meters long with 50 to 150 horsepower engines. The nets are hauled in by hand by a team of crewmembers pulling the lateral wings. The fish are removed with a smaller net or a scoop.
