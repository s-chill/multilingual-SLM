The Fire Brigades Act 1938 ( 1 & 2 Geo. 6 . c. 72) (in force until 1941, repealed 1947) was the primary legislation for Great Britain , excluding London, that placed responsibility for the provision of a fire brigade onto the local authority , and away from the insurance companies.

The act was passed following a report by the Departmental Committee on Fire Brigade Services 1935, which was also known as the Riverdale Committee in reference to its chairman, Lord Riverdale .

The act was only in force for a short time before in 1941 all local authority fire services in Great Britain were transferred to the National Fire Service . After World War II new legislation was passed and the Fire Services Act 1947 took over as the primary legislation dealing with fire services in Great Britain.
