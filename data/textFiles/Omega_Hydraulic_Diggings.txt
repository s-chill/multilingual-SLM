The Omega Hydraulic Diggings are located 1 mile (1.6Â km) north of what was the town of Omega, California during the California Gold Rush . The site is southeast of the unincorporated town of Washington, California .  From SR 20 , the diggings are reachable via the gravel Omega Road which merges with Forest Route 29 in small sections.

The hydraulic diggings became a registered California Historical Landmark (No. 629) on January 1, 1958. The plaque's inscription reads:

ALPHA AND OMEGA One mile north of here were the towns of Alpha and Omega, named by gold miners in the early 1850s. The tremendous hydraulic diggings , visible from near this point, engulfed most of the original townsites. Alpha was the birthplace of famed opera singer Emma Nevada . Mining at Omega continued until 1949, and lumbering operations are carried on there today (1958). California Registered Historical Landmarks Nos. 628-629
