This is a "genealogy" of programming languages . Languages are categorized under the ancestor language with the strongest influence. Those ancestor languages are listed in alphabetic order. Any such categorization has a large arbitrary element, since programming languages often incorporate major ideas from multiple sources.

JOSS also inspired features for several versions of BASIC, including Tymshare 's SUPER BASIC and DEC 's BASIC-PLUS .
