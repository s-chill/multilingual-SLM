The history of social work in Nigeria dates back to the late 19th century when Christian missionaries arrived in the country to spread their faith and provide humanitarian aid. These missionaries provided healthcare, education, and social services to the local populations, but their work was mainly directed at the wealthier classes. As the country developed, the government began to provide more social services, with social work becoming a formal profession in the 1950s. The first organized social work organization in Nigeria was the Nigerian Association of Social Workers (NASW), which was founded in 1950. This organization was responsible for the training of social workers and the development of a code of ethics for the profession. The association also established a social work journal and organized conferences and workshops on social welfare issues. In the 1960s, the Nigerian government passed the Social Welfare Act, which provided for the establishment of a national Social Welfare Board. This board was responsible for formulating and implementing social welfare policies and for monitoring and evaluating the performance of social workers. The board also established a National Institute of Social Work, which was responsible for the training of social workers and the development of standards and guidelines for the profession. In the 1970s, the government passed the Social Welfare Regulations which provided for the establishment of a National Council of Social Workers (NCSW). The council was responsible for setting standards for the practice of social work, for regulating the profession, and for administering the Social Welfare Act. The 1980s saw increased government involvement in the social work profession. The government enacted the Social Work Act of 1981, which provided for the registration of social workers and the establishment of a disciplinary tribunal to investigate and punish social workers who violated the code of ethics. The government also provided additional funding for the training of social workers and the development of social work programs. The 1990s saw significant changes in the social work profession in Nigeria. The government passed the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act of 1998, which provided for the establishment of a National Board of Social Workers. This board was responsible for the registration of social workers, the setting of standards for the profession, the investigation and discipline of social workers, and the accreditation of social work programs. In the 2000s, the government passed the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act of 2004, which provided for the establishment of a National Agency for Social Work. This agency was responsible for the implementation of social welfare policies, the regulation of social work, and the development of social work programs. It also established a social work council, which was responsible for setting standards for the practice of social work, for registering social workers, and for administering the Social Work Act. Today, the social work profession in Nigeria has grown significantly. The government has supported the profession through the provision of funding for training and the development of social work programs. The profession is regulated by the Social Work Council, which is responsible for setting standards for the practice of social work and for registering social workers. The profession is also supported by the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), which provides a platform for social workers to share their experiences and expertise.
