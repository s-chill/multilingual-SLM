"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems" is a paper published in 1949 by Claude Shannon discussing cryptography from the viewpoint of information theory . It is one of the foundational treatments (arguably the foundational treatment) of modern cryptography. His work has been described as a "turning point, and marked the closure of classical cryptography and the beginning of modern cryptography." It has also been described as turning cryptography from an "art to a science". It is also a proof that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad .

The paper serves as the foundation of secret-key cryptography , including the work of Horst Feistel , the Data Encryption Standard (DES) , Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) , and more.

Shannon published an earlier version of this research in the formerly classified report A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography, Memorandum MM 45-110-02, Sept. 1, 1945, Bell Laboratories. This report also precedes the publication of his " A Mathematical Theory of Communication ", which appeared in 1948.
