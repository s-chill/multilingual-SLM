A base metal is a common and inexpensive metal , as opposed to a precious metal such as gold or silver . In numismatics , coins often derived their value  from the precious metal content; however, base metals have also been used in coins in the past and today.

In contrast to noble metals , base metals may be distinguished by oxidizing or corroding relatively easily and reacting variably with diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form hydrogen . Examples include iron , nickel , lead and zinc . Copper is also considered a base metal because it oxidizes relatively easily, although it does not react with HCl.

In mining and economics , the term base metals refers to industrial non-ferrous metals excluding precious metals . These include copper , lead , nickel and zinc .

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is more inclusive in its definition of commercial base metals. Its list includes—in addition to copper, lead, nickel, and zinc—the following metals: iron and steel (an alloy), aluminium , tin , tungsten , molybdenum , tantalum , cobalt , bismuth , cadmium , titanium , zirconium , antimony , manganese , beryllium , chromium , germanium , vanadium , gallium , hafnium , indium , niobium , rhenium , and thallium , and their alloys.

In the context of plated metal products, the base metal underlies the plating metal, as copper underlies silver in Sheffield plate .
