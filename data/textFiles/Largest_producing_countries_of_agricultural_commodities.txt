Production (and consumption) of agricultural plant commodities has a diverse geographical distribution. Along with climate and corresponding types of vegetation , the economy of a nation also influences the level of agricultural production. Production of some products is highly concentrated in a few countries, China, the leading producer of wheat and ramie in 2013, produces 95% of the world's ramie fiber but only 17% of the world's wheat. Products with more evenly distributed production see more frequent changes in the ranking of the top producers.

The major agricultural products can be broadly categorised into foods , fibers , fuels , and raw materials .
