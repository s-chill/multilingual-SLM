In October 2021, Google announced Android 12L, an interim release of Android 12 including improvements specific for foldable phones , tablets , desktop -sized screens and Chromebooks , and modifications to the user interface to tailor it to larger screens. It was planned to launch in early 2022. Developer Preview 1 of Android 12L was released in October 2021, followed by Beta 1 in December 2021, Beta 2 in January 2022, and Beta 3 in February 2022. The stable version of Android 12L was released for devices with large screens on March 7, 2022, and was released as "Android 12.1" for Pixel smartphones on the same date, besides the Pixel 6 & Pixel 6 Pro.

Android 12 introduces a major refresh to the operating system's Material Design language branded as " Material You ", which features larger buttons, increased use of animation, and a new style for home screen widgets . A feature, internally codenamed "monet", allows the operating system to automatically generate a color theme for system menus and supported apps using the colors of the user's wallpaper.

The smart home and Wallet areas added to the power menu on Android 11 have been relocated to the notification shade, while Google Assistant is now activated by holding the power button. Android 12 features native support for taking scrolling screenshots.

The screen magnifier feature now allows partial magnification via a floating window, and can also be configured to follow text inputs.

Performance improvements have been made to system services such as the window and package managers. The Android Runtime has been added to Project Mainline, allowing it to be serviced via Play Store .

Android 12 adds support for spatial audio , and MPEG-H 3D Audio , and supports transcoding of HEVC video for backwards compatibility with apps which do not support it. A new API known as HapticGenerator allows the OS to generate haptic feedback from audio on compatible devices.

A "rich content insertion" API eases the ability to transfer formatted text and media between apps, such as via the clipboard . Third party app stores now have the ability to update apps without constantly asking the user for permission.

OS-level machine learning functions are sandboxed within the "Android Private Compute Core", which is expressly prohibited from accessing networks.

Apps requesting location data can now be restricted to having access only to "approximate" location data rather than "precise". Controls to prevent apps from using the camera and microphone system-wide have been added to the quick settings toggles. An indicator will also be displayed on-screen if they are active.
