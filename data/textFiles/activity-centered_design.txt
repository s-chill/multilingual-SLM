Activity-centered design ( ACD ) is an extension of the Human-centered design paradigm in interaction design . ACD features heavier emphasis on the activities that a user would perform with a given piece of technology. ACD has its theoretical underpinnings in activity theory , from which activities can be defined as actions taken by a user to achieve a goal.

When working with activity-centered design, the designers use research to get insights of the users. Observations and interviews are typical approaches to learn more about the users' behavior . By mapping users' activities and tasks, the designer may notice missing tasks for the activity to become more easy to perform, and thus design solutions to accomplish those tasks.
