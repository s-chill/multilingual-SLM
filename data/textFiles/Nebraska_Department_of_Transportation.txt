The Nebraska Department of Transportation ( NDOT ) is the state government agency charged with building and maintaining the state highways in the U.S. state of Nebraska , as well as the state's airports. The main headquarters of the agency is located in Lincoln , the capital city. There are currently eight NDOT district offices located across the state.

The agency was formed on July 1, 2017, following the merger of the Nebraska Department of Roads and the Nebraska Department of Aeronautics, the last of all 50 US states to do something of the like.

The Department of Transportation manages the Nebraska State Highway System , including the U.S. Highways and Interstate Highways within the state.

More than 20 bridges and other public works projects built or designed by the Nebraska Department of Transportation and its predecessors, including the Nebraska Department of Roads and the Nebraska Bureau of Roads & Bridges , have been listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places . Many were registered after a 1996 study seeking to inventory historic bridges in Nebraska and pursuant to a Multiple Property Submission titled "Highway Bridges in Nebraska." The projects listed on the National Register include:
