Midwater trawling is trawling , or net fishing, at a depth that is higher in the water column than the bottom of the ocean. It is contrasted with bottom trawling . Midwater trawling is also known as pelagic trawling and bottom trawling as benthic trawling.

In midwater trawling, a cone-shaped net can be towed behind a single boat and spread by trawl doors, or it  can be towed behind two boats ( pair trawling ) which act as the spreading device. Midwater trawling catches pelagic fish such as anchovies , shrimp , tuna and mackerel , whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom living fish ( groundfish ) and semi-pelagic fish such as: cod , squid , halibut and rockfish .

Whilst midwater trawling does not damage the seafloor (like bottom trawling ), the method is not perfectly selective and results in relatively high levels of discards of unwanted catches.
