transport logistic is the world´s biggest trade show for logistics, mobility, IT and supply chain management. It takes place every two years in early May, at the Messe München exhibition center in Munich. The organizer is Neue Messe München .

Integrated within the framework of transport logistic are also Air Cargo Europe, an international trade conference and exhibition for the air cargo business, and marilog, an international conference on maritime logistics.
