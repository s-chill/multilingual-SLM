A folding bridge is a type of moveable bridge engineered to fold. This allows ship traffic to pass through the waterway that the bridge spans.

An example of a folding bridge is the Hörnbrücke ( Hörn Bridge ) in the city of Kiel in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein . When the bridge is down it spans 25.5 metres (84 ft) across the Kiel Fjord, known as the Hörn. The three-segment bascule bridge folds up into the shape of the capital letter N to allow for ship and boat traffic.
