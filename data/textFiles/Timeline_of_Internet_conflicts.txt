The Internet has a long history of turbulent relations, major maliciously designed disruptions (such as wide scale computer virus incidents, DOS and DDOS attacks that cripple services, and organized attacks that cripple major online communities), and other conflicts. This is a list of known and documented Internet, Usenet , virtual community and World Wide Web related conflicts, and of conflicts that touch on both offline and online worlds with possibly wider reaching implications.

Spawned from the original ARPANET , the modern Internet, World Wide Web and other services on it, such as virtual communities ( bulletin boards , forums , and Massively multiplayer online games ) have grown exponentially. Such prolific growth of population, mirroring "offline" society, contributes to the number of conflicts and problems online growing each year.  Today, billions of people in nearly all countries use various parts of the Internet.  Inevitably, as in "brick and mortar" or offline society, the virtual equivalent of major turning points, conflicts, and disruptionsâ€”the online equivalents of the falling of the Berlin Wall , the creation of the United Nations , spread of disease , and events like the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will occur. Criteria for inclusion to this article may range from small-scale incidents such as online bomb threats to large scale cyberterrorism instances such as hacks of critical infrastructures.
