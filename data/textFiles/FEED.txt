Front-end loading (FEL), also referred to as Front End Planning (FEP), pre-project planning (PPP), feasibility analysis , conceptual planning , programming/schematic design and early project planning , is the process for conceptual development of projects in processing industries such as upstream oil and gas , petrochemical , natural gas refining , extractive metallurgy , waste-to-energy , biotechnology , and pharmaceuticals . This involves developing sufficient strategic information with which owners can address risk and make decisions to commit resources in order to maximize the potential for success.

Front-end loading includes robust planning and design early in a project's lifecycle (i.e., the front end of a project), at a time when the ability to influence changes in design is relatively high and the cost to make those changes is relatively low.  It typically applies to industries with highly capital intensive, long lifecycle projects (i.e., hundreds of millions or billions of dollars over several years before any revenue is produced).  Though it often adds a small amount of time and cost to the early portion of a project, these costs are minor compared to the alternative of the costs and effort required to make changes at a later stage in the project.

It also typically uses a stage-gate process, whereby a project must pass through formal gates at well defined milestones within the project's lifecycle before receiving funding to proceed to the next stage of work. The quality of front-end planning can be improved through the use of PDRI (Project Definition Rating Index) as a part of the stage-gate process.

Front-end loading is usually followed by detailed design or detailed engineering .

It is common industry practice to divide front-end-loading activities into Five stages. For each stage, typical deliverables are listed given belowÂ :

Another FEL methodology splits the project into four phases:
