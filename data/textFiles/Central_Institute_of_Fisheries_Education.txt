The Central Institute of Fisheries Education ( CIFE ) is a Deemed to be a University and institution of higher learning for fisheries science in Mumbai , India . CIFE has over four decades of leadership in human resource development with its alumni aiding in the development of fisheries and aquaculture worldwide, producing notable contributions to research and technological advancements to their credit. It was ranked 9th in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework in the agriculture and allied sectors ranking for 2024.

The institute is one of four deemed to be universities operating under the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR); the other three being the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI) and the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI)

A total of five centres operate under CIFE, including ones at the ICAR CIFE Rohtak centre at Rohtak in Haryana state, Kolkata in West Bengal state, Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh state, Pawarkheda in Madhya Pradesh state and Motihari in Bihar state.

CIFE was instituted in 1961 originally as an in service training centre to impart proficient training and education to fisheries professionals to equip them to face the growing challenges in the fisheries sector. Taking its  efforts of almost twenty years into consideration, CIFE came under the administrative control of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research. It was then conferred Deemed University status in 1989 by the University Grants Commission . As such, CIFE incorporated provisions for both research and education in its mandate. It has since made significant contributions towards enriching the quality of fisheries education in India. As per the letter dated 10 November - 2017, University Grants Commission, the higher education authority, the word University has been dropped from the CIFE name and it was replaced by Deemed to be university.

CIFE offers Master of Fisheries Science (M.F.Sc) and PhD programs in specialised branches of fisheries science, undertakes research, conducts capacity enhancement programs, and provides technical support and consultancy to development agencies, fishers, farmers and entrepreneurs. CIFE offers M.F.Sc and Ph.D programs under 11 various disciplines including: Aquaculture, Aquatic Environment Management, Aquatic Animal Health, Fisheries Resource Management, Fish Biochemistry & Physiology, Fish Nutrition & Feed Technology, Fish Genetics & Breeding, Fish Biotechnology, Fisheries Extension, Fisheries Economics and Post-Harvest Technology
