Decision downloading refers to communicating a decision to those who have not been involved in the decision-making process.

The term “decision downloading” is used to set apart those special situations in which
decision-makers communicate a decision that has already been made. It applies when the communicators cannot,
for whatever reason, keep everyone informed in real-time about the decision-making process.

Decision downloaders can be classified into three groups: robust, restricted, and remedial.

Robust downloaders discuss:

Restricted downloaders discuss some of the above issues, while remedial downloaders discuss few of them.

Robust decision downloaders have a different frame of reference than their less effective
counterparts. They view themselves more as educators than cheerleaders. They recognize that
education cannot be “once and done”. They know employees learn at different rates, in different
ways and from different of sources

In each situation, the decisionmakers —either by choice or by prior agreement— do not involve
others in the decision-making process. Discussions leading to the decision are often deep, nuanced and sometimes contentious. The decisions are frequently complex, often difficult to understand, and
sometimes controversial. Simply put, the nature of the decision-making process and the features of
the decision itself often make any subsequent communications about the decision extraordinarily difficult. Often, the subsequent communications are an afterthought borne out of psychological exhaustion from the decision-making process itself. Consequently, decision-makers frequently stumble through the “decision downloading process”. Researchers have found that only 50% of all decisions ever get implemented and sustained.

The term was coined by Phillip G. Clampitt and M. Lee Williams in an article published in the MIT Sloan Management Review , Winter 2007. [1]

The causes of poor decision downloading include:

Researchers have reported that:

Since this is a relatively new concept there have not been replications of the original research.
