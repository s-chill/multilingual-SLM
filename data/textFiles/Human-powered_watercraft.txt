Human-powered watercraft are watercraft propelled only by human power , instead of being propelled by wind power (via one or more sails ) or an engine .

The three main methods of exerting human power are:

While most human-powered watercraft use buoyancy to maintain their position relative to the surface of the water, a few, such as human-powered hydrofoils and human-powered submarines , use hydrofoils , either alone or in addition to buoyancy.

Oars are held at one end, have a blade on the other end, and pivot in between in oarlocks .

Oared craft include:

Using oars in pairs, with one hand on each oar, is two-oar sculling . The oars may also be called sculls.

Two-oared sculled craft include:

Using oars individually, with both hands on a single oar, is sweep or sweep-oar rowing . In this case the rowers are usually paired so that there is an oar on each side of the boat.

Sweep-oared craft include:

Moving a single stern-mounted oar from side to side, while changing the angle of the blade so as to generate forward thrust on both strokes, is single-oar sculling .

Single-oar sculled craft include:

Paddled watercraft, or paddlecraft, uses one or more handheld paddles , each with a widened blade on one or both ends, to push water and propel the watercraft.. Commonly seen paddlecrafts include:

Pedals are attached to a crank and propelled in circles, or to a treadle and reciprocated , with the feet. The collected power is then transferred to the water with a paddle wheel , flippers , or to the air or water with a propeller .

Pedaled craft include:

A pole is held with both hands and used to push against the bottom.

Poled craft include:

Other types of human-powered watercraft include:
