William George Dance, Jr. ; October 7, 1940) is an angler and host of Bill Dance Outdoors , a fishing television series on the Outdoor Channel , and Bill Dance Saltwater on the Sportsman Channel .

Raised in Lynchburg , Tennessee , Dance considered becoming a doctor, but changed his mind after happening upon a grisly motorcycle accident in the early 1960s. He then turned his focus to competing in bass tournaments. A fishing lure manufacturer that sponsored him suggested he should start a TV show to promote the product. The program originally began on WHBQ-TV , then the ABC affiliate in Memphis , in 1968.

Dance's signature look includes sunglasses and a Tennessee Volunteers baseball cap.  He received his first cap from their coach, Doug Dickey , in the late 1960s.  He lives in Eads , with his wife, Dianne.
