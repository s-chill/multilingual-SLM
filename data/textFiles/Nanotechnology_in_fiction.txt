The use of nanotechnology in fiction has attracted scholarly attention. The first use of the distinguishing concepts of nanotechnology was " There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom ", a talk given by physicist Richard Feynman in 1959. K. Eric Drexler 's 1986 book Engines of Creation introduced the general public to the concept of nanotechnology. Since then, nanotechnology has been used frequently in a diverse range of fiction, often as a justification for unusual or far-fetched occurrences featured in speculative fiction .

In 1931, Boris Zhitkov wrote a short story titled "Microhands" ( Микроруки ), where the narrator builds for himself a pair of microscopic remote manipulators and uses them for fine tasks like eye surgery . When he attempts to build even smaller manipulators operated by the first pair, the story goes into detail about the problem of regular materials behaving differently on a microscopic scale.

In his 1956 short story titled " The Next Tenants " , Arthur C. Clarke describes tiny machines that operate at the micrometer scale – although not strictly nanoscale ("billionth of a meter"), they are the first fictional example of the concepts now associated with nanotechnology.

A concept similar to nanotechnology, called "micromechanical devices," was described in Stanislaw Lem 's 1959 novel Eden . These devices were used by the aliens as "seeds" to grow a wall around the human spaceship. Lem's 1964 novel The Invincible involves the discovery of an artificial ecosystem of minuscule robots, although like in Clarke's story they are larger than what is strictly meant by the term 'nanotechnology'.

Robert Silverberg 's 1969 short story How It Was when the Past Went Away describes nanotechnology being used in the construction of stereo loudspeakers, with a thousand speakers per inch.

The 1984 novel Peace on Earth by Stanislaw Lem tells about small bacteria-sized nanorobots that look like normal dust (developed by artificial intelligence placed by humans on the Moon in the era of cold warfare) that later come to Earth and are begin replicating, destroying all weapons, modern technology and software, while leaving living organisms (as there were no living organisms on the Moon) intact.

The 1985 novel Blood Music by Greg Bear (originally a 1983 short story) features genetically engineered white blood cells that eventually learn to manipulate matter on an atomic scale.

The 1991 novelization of Terminator 2: Judgment Day , authored by Randall Frakes , expands the origin story of the T-1000 Terminator through the inclusion of a prologue set in the future. It is explained that the T-1000 is a 'Nanomorph', created by Skynet , through the use of programmable nanotechnology. This was only implied in the film itself.

The 1992 novel Assemblers of Infinity is a science-fiction novel authored by Kevin J. Anderson and Doug Beason. The plot line makes specific mention of nano-assembly and nano-disassembly robots, along with admonitions regarding the dangers that these bacteria-sized machines might pose.

In Kim Stanley Robinson 's Red Mars (1992), the extraordinary tensile strength of carbon nanotubes is used to create a tether for a space elevator , which connects Mars to an asteroid that has been led into orbit around the planet. The space elevator speeds travel of people and materials between Earth and Mars, but also creates tension between factions — and is later destroyed.

Neal Stephenson 's 1995 novel The Diamond Age is set in a world where nanotechnology is commonplace. Nanoscale warfare, fabrication at the molecular scale, and self-assembling islands all exist.

The morphing technology in Animorphs is described as a form of nanotechnology that allows its users to transform into other animal and alien species, as well as members of their own species.

The Trinity Blood series features an alien nanomachine found on Mars that is present in the body of the protagonist, Abel Nightroad. These nanomachines are known as Krusnik nanomachines, and feed on the cells of vampires.

Nanobots (called Nanoes) are central to Stel Pavlou 's novel Decipher (2001).

Michael Crichton 's novel Prey (2002) is a cautionary tale about the possible risks of developing nanotechnology. In Prey , a swarm of molecule-sized nanorobots develops intelligence and becomes a large scale threat.

Robert Ludlum 's 2005 novel The Lazarus Vendetta also focuses on nanotechnology, particularly its ability to cure cancer.

The 2006 children's novel The Doomsday Dust (book 4 in the Spy Gear Adventures series by Rick Barba) features a nanite swarm as the villain.

A nanomorph, a term first coined by science fiction writer David Pulver in 1986's GURPS Robots , is a fictional robot entirely made of nanomachines . Its brain is distributed throughout its whole body, which also acts as an all-around sensor, making it impossible to surprise as long as the target is in line of sight. A nanomorph is arguably the robotic ultimate in versatility, maybe even in power. Further uses of the concept could include using parts of its body as a tracking to perform several tasks, or merging with another nanomorphs to form a greater one, or gliding/flying like an ornithopter (by molding itself into a giant, articulated kite ). A common improvement is the ability to cover itself with specific colors and textures in a realistic manner (the ultimate being to look like a human, à la doppelgänger ).

In the Expanse series, the protomolecule was created by a race of ancient aliens and sent to star systems across the galaxy to terraform planets into habitable worlds and develop a gateway network to facilitate interstellar travel. The protomolecule could consume biomass and technology and use them to serve various functions. Numerous violent conflicts occurred between factions of humanity, notably the United Nations, Martian Congressional Republic, Outer Planets Alliance, and Laconian Empire, for control of this technology.

Rudy Rucker 's 2007 novel Postsingular depicts the protagonists' experiences with three generations of swarm nanorobots: "nants", initially tasked with consuming the Earth and Moon (including organic life) to create a virtual Earth before being reversed; "orphids", tasked with a more ubiquitous and assistive role in augmenting reality , interfacing with human thought and even enabling interdimensional travel; and "silps", which accomplish the Singularity by replacing the previous generations of nanorobots and enable organic beings and inorganic material on Earth to express sentient, intelligible thought to each other. Rucker's 2009 sequel Hylozoic continues the protagonists' experiences with silps after the Singularity as they enable interstellar and interdimensional travel and communication with Earth by extraterrestrial beings who have already experienced similar Singularities themselves.

One of the first mentions on a television show was an announcement to students over the school loudspeakers in the 1987 Max Headroom episode, " Academy " that, "Nanotechnology pod test results are posted in the Submicron Lab for your viewing."

The anime series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex employs a plotline heavily involved in the use of "micromachines" as a form of treatment against complex diseases after a subject undergoing cyberisation.

In the Star Trek universe, from Star Trek: The Next Generation onward, the Borg use nanomachines, referred to as nanoprobes , to assimilate individuals into their collective. In another episode, an experiment by Wesley Crusher gone awry led to nanites developing a collective intelligence and interfering with ship systems, eventually being deposited on a planet to establish their own civilization.

On the television show Red Dwarf , nanobots played a notable role in series VII to IX. Nanobots are nanotechnology created to be a self-repair system for androids like Kryten as they can also change anything into anything else. Kryten's nanobots grow bored of their duties and take over the ship Red Dwarf , leaving the crew to try and recapture it aboard the smaller Starbug . In the end the ship they are chasing is actually a smaller Red Dwarf built by the nanobots (which evaded their scanners in the end by coming aboard Starbug ), with the rest being changed into a planet. Once the crew discover this and find the nanobots, they force them to rebuild Red Dwarf (as well as Dave Lister 's then-missing arm). In the end the nanobots build an enhanced Red Dwarf based on the original design plans. They also resurrect the original full crew killed in the first episode .

The episode The New Breed of the show Outer Limits featured nanobots.

Nanobots were also featured during the Sci-Fi Channel era of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , where they were known as "nanites". They were depicted on the show as microscopic, bug-like, freestanding robots with distinct personalities.

Nanotechnology is featured heavily within the Terminator film series. The 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day and 2015 film Terminator: Genisys feature the T-1000 terminator. The T-1000 is composed of Mimetic Polyalloy, a liquid metal that utilizes nanites for shapeshifting abilities; Giving the T-1000 the ability to mimic anyone it samples through physical contact.  It can also form its arms into blades and stabbing weapons and instantly recover from any damage. In the 2003 film Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines a new terminator, the T-X , also utilities Mimetic Polyalloy for shapeshifting abilities; like the T-1000 it can mimic anyone it touches. The T-X is also equipped with nanotechnological transjectors, and can infect and control other machines using nanites.

In Terminator Genisys , human resistance leader John Connor is infected with "machine phase matter" by a T-5000 terminator, transforming John into a " T-3000 ". The T-3000, like the T-1000 and T-X units, has shapeshifting and replication abilities. This unit's deadly structure gives the T-3000 the unique ability to instantly scatter into particles and then quickly reform to avoid harmful impact as well as instantly recovering from damage.

In the 2014 film Transcendence , the uploaded consciousness of Will Caster (Johnny Depp) uses nanotechnology to turn himself, and the local townsfolk, into a self-healing defense force with superhuman strength.

In Venture Brothers Season 6 Episode 3 " Faking Miracles " a laboratory accident leads nanobots to enter Dean Venture's body. Billy Quizboy and Peter White take remote control of the nanobots, inadvertently torturing Dean to showcase the power of the nanobots to Dr. Venture. Eventually they are used, unbeknownst to Dean, to improve his intelligence so that he can pass an entrance examination for college. In the post-credit scene Dean painfully urinates them out like a set of kidney stones.
