He also conceived and, with Sutter and Alexandrescu, co-organized and presented another boutique conference, C++ and Beyond annually in 2010-2014.

Meyers has expressed opposition to asking programmers to solve design or programming problems during job interviews:

"I hate anything that asks me to design on the spot. That's asking to demonstrate a skill rarely required on the job in a high-stress environment, where it is difficult for a candidate to accurately prove their abilities. I think it's fundamentally an unfair thing to request of a candidate."

In December 2015, Meyers announced his retirement from the world of C++.
