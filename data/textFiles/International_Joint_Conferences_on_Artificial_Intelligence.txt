The International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence ( IJCAI ) is a conference in the field of artificial intelligence . The conference series has been organized by the nonprofit IJCAI Organization since 1969. It was held biennially in odd-numbered years from 1969 to 2015 and annually starting from 2016. More recently, IJCAI was held jointly every four years with ECAI since 2018 and PRICAI since 2020 to promote collaboration of AI researchers and practitioners. IJCAI covers a broad range of research areas in the field of AI. It is a large and highly selective conference, with only about 20% or less of the submitted papers accepted after peer review in the 5 years leading up to 2022.

Three research awards are given at each IJCAI conference.

Additionally, IJCAI presents one or more Best Paper Awards at each conference to recognize the highest quality papers.
