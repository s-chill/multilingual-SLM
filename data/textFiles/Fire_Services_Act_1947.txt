The Fire Services Act 1947 ( 10 & 11 Geo. 6 . c. 41) was an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom that reorganised fire services in the United Kingdom . It disbanded the National Fire Service and returned the responsibility for running fire services to local authorities.

While the original Act did not contain an "Extent" section, the Preamble and text addressed Great Britain (and parts thereof) only.

The Fire Services Act 1947 was entirely repealed in England and Wales by the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 , now the primary legislation for England and Wales.

The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 extended only to England and Wales, thus leaving the Fire Services Act 1947 in force in Scotland. Most of the 1947 Act was later repealed by the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 , which left ss. 26 to 27A (concerning the Firemen's Pension Scheme) still in force in Scotland.

The Act does not extend to Northern Ireland .
