A Civil estimator is a construction professional who bids on civil projects that have gone to tender. Civil estimators typically have a background in civil engineering , construction project management , or construction supervision . Estimators are responsible for obtaining tenders, obtaining of material costs, calculation of tenders taking into consideration project management and overheads. The role of an estimator can be a very pressured one, and requires a great level of concentration, some of which will result in erratic office hours to ensure tender return dates can be achieved.
