Applied engineering prepares graduates to apply mathematics, science, technology, and engineering methods to manage, or support engineering functions. Includes instruction in engineering management, project management, six sigma, production, operations management, systems engineering, auto cad, basic programming, and quality control.  The additional application of system design, testing, repairing products, execution of new product designs, and improvement of manufacturing processes.

Applied engineering is also known as engineering management or engineering technology. Students typically graduate from an engineering program. Many applied engineering programs do not require ABET credidation as traditional engineering programs. Unlike ABET engineering programs that mainly focus on designs. Applied Engineering supports engineering designs.

Students will demonstrate the following management competencies that clearly distinguish them from traditional engineering graduates.

• Use appropriate statistical techniques in variable and attribute control charts and in sampling tables for continuous improvement.

• Evaluate and/or implement total quality systems in industry.

• Perform production scheduling , develop and monitor an inventory control system, utilize appropriate production planning techniques, and identify and exhibit key factors in project management.

• Exhibit knowledge of federal and state safety legislation and identify the role of management in an industrial safety program.

• Recognize, evaluate and control varied industrial health and safety hazards.

• Demonstrate knowledge of traditional management functions and practices, including applications and limitations of various management schemes.

• Solve problems in typical industrial organizations, work effectively in teams, and demonstrate knowledge of the managed area of an industrial enterprise.

• Apply business, and engineering  economic principles to solve complex problems.

• Identify responsibility of supervision and management within various industries.

• Demonstrate communication skills, safe and efficient individual and group work habits, leadership within groups and an attitude of cooperation and tolerance.

Applied engineering students specialize in a technical area of study. Students apply hands on techniques to manage, improve, or support engineering projects, systems, processes or business operations. Examples of these technical specialties include: automation / robotics , aviation, computer aided drafting & design, Minitab, MS Project, electro-mechanical, electronics , construction, graphics, communications, manufacturing, nanofabrication .

Applied engineers are employed in a wide array of industries including: manufacturing, service, architecture, construction, transportation, healthcare, printing/publishing and distribution. Although a degree in applied engineering is not considered a traditional design engineering degree (those eligible to sit for the Professional Engineering Examination), employers hire applied engineering and engineering technology graduates with the term "engineer" in their job titles. Examples of the use of Applied Engineering titles include: Engineering Manager, Project Engineer, Applications Engineer, Service Engineer, Equipment Engineer, Test Engineer, Quality Engineer, Systems Engineer, Manufacture Engineer, Field Engineer, Process Engineer, Product Engineer, Safety Engineer, and Sales Engineer.

Graduates of applied engineering programs are frequently found in technical positions due to their coursework, training and experience in Mathematics , engineering economics, business statistics, business calculus financial & managerial accounting , operations & service management , quality control , industrial safety, value engineering, six sigma, quality assurance, engineering law, engineering leadership & ethics, systems engineering and engineering management. Common management-related titles may also include: engineering manager, construction manager, plant manager, project manager, and technical manager.

Applied engineers in project management positions take an engineering design and see it through planning, implementation, execution and monitoring and controlling. They wear many hats in industry, commanding the necessary resources and personnel to contribute to an organization's bottom line.There is no clear distinction made between engineer or applied engineering as in most jobs in industry. Unless noted in a job description as ABET requirement for traditional engineers. The degree or course of study is applied engineering, the career is engineering.

The Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in applied engineering. An instructor or graduate of an applied engineering program may choose to become a certified technology manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering production planning and control , safety, quality, and management/supervision.

ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) for accrediting Applied Engineering programs. CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the US for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in the United States.(2011)
