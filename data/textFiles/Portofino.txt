Portofino ( Italian pronunciation: [ˌpɔrtoˈfiːno] ; Ligurian : Portofin [ˌpɔɾtuˈfiŋ] ) is a comune located in the Metropolitan City of Genoa on the Italian Riviera . The town is clustered around its small harbour, and is known for the colourfully painted buildings that line the shore. Since the late 19th century, Portofino has attracted tourism of the European aristocracy and it is now a resort for the world's jet set .

Pliny the Elder (AD 23 – AD 79) referred to Portus Delphini (Port of the Dolphin) as on the Ligurian coast between Genoa and the Gulf of Tigullio .

The village is mentioned in a diploma from 986 by Adelaide of Italy , which assigned it to the nearby Abbey of San Fruttuoso di Capodimonte . In 1171, together with the neighbouring Santa Margherita Ligure , it was included in Rapallo 's commune jurisdiction. After 1229 it was part of the Republic of Genoa . The town's natural harbour supported a fleet of fishing boats, but was somewhat too cramped to provide more than a temporary safe haven for the growing merchant marine of the Republic of Genoa.

In 1409, when Charles VI of France was Doge of Genoa , he sold Portofino to the Republic of Florence . When Charles was ousted from Genoa, the Florentines gave it back. In the 15th century it was a fief of families such as the Fieschi , Spinola , Adorno , and Doria .

In 1815, it became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia and, from 1861, of the unified Kingdom of Italy .

In the late 19th century, first British, then other Northern European aristocratic tourists began to visit Portofino, which they reached by horse and cart from Santa Margherita Ligure . Aubrey Herbert and Elizabeth von Arnim were among the more famous English people to make the area fashionable. Eventually, more expatriates built expensive holiday houses, and by 1950, tourism had replaced fishing as the town's chief industry, and the waterfront was a continuous ring of restaurants and cafés.
