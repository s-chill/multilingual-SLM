In mathematics, Krener's theorem is a result attributed to Arthur J. Krener in geometric control theory about the topological properties of attainable sets of finite-dimensional control systems.  It states that any attainable set of a bracket-generating system has nonempty interior or, equivalently, that any attainable set has nonempty interior in the topology of the corresponding orbit . Heuristically, Krener's theorem prohibits attainable sets from being hairy .

Let q ˙ = f ( q , u ) {\displaystyle {\ }{\dot {q}}=f(q,u)} be a smooth control system, where q {\displaystyle {\ q}} belongs to a finite-dimensional manifold M {\displaystyle \ M} and u {\displaystyle \ u} belongs to a control set U {\displaystyle \ U} . Consider the family  of vector fields F = { f ( ⋅ , u ) ∣ u ∈ U } {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}=\{f(\cdot ,u)\mid u\in U\}} .

Let L i e F {\displaystyle \ \mathrm {Lie} \,{\mathcal {F}}} be the Lie algebra generated by F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} with respect to the Lie bracket of vector fields . 
Given q ∈ M {\displaystyle \ q\in M} , if the vector space L i e q F = { g ( q ) ∣ g ∈ L i e F } {\displaystyle \ \mathrm {Lie} _{q}\,{\mathcal {F}}=\{g(q)\mid g\in \mathrm {Lie} \,{\mathcal {F}}\}} is equal to T q M {\displaystyle \ T_{q}M} ,
then q {\displaystyle \ q} belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from q {\displaystyle \ q} .

Even if L i e q F {\displaystyle \mathrm {Lie} _{q}\,{\mathcal {F}}} is different from T q M {\displaystyle \ T_{q}M} ,
the attainable set from q {\displaystyle \ q} has nonempty interior in the orbit topology,
as it follows from Krener's theorem applied to the control system restricted to the orbit through q {\displaystyle \ q} .

When all the vector fields in F {\displaystyle \ {\mathcal {F}}} are analytic, L i e q F = T q M {\displaystyle \ \mathrm {Lie} _{q}\,{\mathcal {F}}=T_{q}M} if and only if q {\displaystyle \ q} belongs to the closure of the interior of the attainable set from q {\displaystyle \ q} . This is a consequence of Krener's theorem and of the orbit theorem .

As a corollary of Krener's theorem one can prove that if the system is bracket-generating and if the attainable set from q ∈ M {\displaystyle \ q\in M} is dense in M {\displaystyle \ M} , then the attainable set from q {\displaystyle \ q} is actually equal to M {\displaystyle \ M} .
