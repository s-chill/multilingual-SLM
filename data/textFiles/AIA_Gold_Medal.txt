The AIA Gold Medal is awarded by the American Institute of Architects conferred "by the national AIA Board of Directors in recognition of a significant body of work of lasting influence on the theory and practice of architecture."

It is the Institute's highest award. The medal was established in 1907. Since 1947, the medal has been awarded more-or-less annually.
