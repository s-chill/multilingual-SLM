frame ( third-person singular simple present frames , present participle framing , simple past and past participle framed )

From Middle English frame ( “ profit, benefit, advantage; a structure composed according to a plan ” ) , from the verb (above) and also from Old Norse frami ( “ advantage, fame, bravery, efficiency, privilege, honor ” ) ; and frame ( “ a framework or structure of any kind ” ) which is of uncertain origin. The latter is usually regarded as a derivative of former; however, compare the rare Anglo-Norman and Old French frame , fraine ( “ frame, framework ” ) , itself of uncertain origin, which might be a borrowing from the English, from the Norse, or even possibly ultimately from Frankish *hramu ( “ frame ” ) related to Dutch raam ( “ window frame ” ) .
