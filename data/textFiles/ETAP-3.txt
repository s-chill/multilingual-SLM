ETAP-3 is a proprietary linguistic processing system focusing on English and Russian . It was developed in Moscow , Russia at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems ( ru:Институт проблем передачи информации им. А. А. Харкевича РАН ). It is a rule-based system which uses the Meaning-Text Theory as its theoretical foundation. At present, there are several applications of ETAP-3, such as a machine translation tool, a converter of the Universal Networking Language , an interactive learning tool for Russian language learners and a syntactically annotated corpus of Russian language. Demo versions of some of these tools are available online .

The ETAP-3 machine translation tool can translate text from English into Russian and vice versa. It is a rule-based system, which makes it different from the most present-day systems that are predominantly statistical-based. The system makes a syntactical analysis of the input sentence, which can be visualized as a syntax tree .

The machine translation tool uses bilingual dictionaries which contain more than 100,000 lexical entries.

The UNL converter based on ETAP-3 can transform English and Russian sentences into their representations in UNL ( Universal Networking Language ) and generate English and Russian sentences from their UNL representations.

A syntactically annotated corpus ( treebank ) is a part of Russian National Corpus . It contains 40,000 sentences (600,000 words) which are fully syntactically and morphologically annotated. The primary annotation was made by ETAP-3 and then manually verified by competent linguists. This makes the syntactically annotated corpus a reliable tool for linguistic research.

The ETAP-3 system makes extensive use of lexical functions explored in  the Meaning-Text Theory . For this reason, an interactive tool for Russian language learners aiming at the acquisition of lexical functions has been developed. Such learning tools are now being created for German , Spanish and Bulgarian
