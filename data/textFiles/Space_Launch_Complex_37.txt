Space Launch Complex 37 ( SLC-37 ), previously Launch Complex 37 ( LC-37 ), is a launch complex on Cape Canaveral Space Force Station , Florida.  Construction began in 1959 and the site was accepted by NASA to support the Saturn I program in 1963. The complex consists of two launch pads. LC-37A has never been used, but LC-37B launched uncrewed Saturn I flights (1964 to 1965) and was modified and launched Saturn IB flights (1966 to 1968), including the first (uncrewed) test of the Apollo Lunar Module in space ( Apollo 5 ). It was deactivated in 1972.  In 2001 it was modified as the launch site for Delta IV , a launch system operated by United Launch Alliance .

The original layout of the launch complex featured one Mobile Service Structure which could be used to service or mate a rocket on either LC-37A or 37B, but not on both simultaneously. The Delta IV Mobile Service Tower is 330 ft (100 m) tall, and fitted to service all Delta IV configurations, including the Delta IV Heavy . Plans are being proposed for SpaceX Starship operations from LC-37 in near future, as the Delta family 's last rocket, i.e., Delta IV Heavy retired in April 2024. The draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) by the Federal Aviation Administration is due in December 2024, with a final study by September 2025.

All flights operated by NASA.

In 1998, Boeing secured the right to use SLC-37 for launch of the Delta IV rocket family. Facility modifications were made to SLC-37B and the first launch occurred in 2002. The Delta IV Medium was launched from SLC-37 from 2002 until 2022, and the Delta IV Heavy had been launched from SLC-37 from 2004 to 2024.

In 2024, after the retirement of the Delta IV Heavy , the FAA initiated an Environmental Impact Statement for potential Starship launch activity from the complex. The draft is set to be released by December 2024.
