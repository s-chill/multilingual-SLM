This is an index to notable programming languages , in current or historical use. Dialects of BASIC , esoteric programming languages , and markup languages are not included. A programming language does not need to be imperative or Turing-complete , but must be executable and so does not include markup languages such as HTML or XML , but does include domain-specific languages such as SQL and its dialects.
