gtkmm (formerly known as gtk-- or gtk minus minus ) is the official C++ interface for the popular GUI library GTK . gtkmm is free software distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

gtkmm allows the creation of user interfaces either in code or with the Glade Interface Designer , using the Gtk::Builder class. Other features include typesafe callbacks , a comprehensive set of graphical control elements , and the extensibility of widgets via inheritance .

Because gtkmm is the official C++ interface of the GUI library GTK , C++ programmers can use the common OOP techniques such as inheritance , and C++-specific facilities such as STL (In fact, many of the gtkmm interfaces, especially those for widget containers , are designed to be similar to the Standard Template Library (STL)).

Main features of gtkmm are listed as follows:

The above program will create a window with a button labeled "Hello World". The button sends "Hello world" to standard output when clicked.

The program is run using the following commands:

This is usually done using a simple makefile .

Some notable applications that use gtkmm include:
