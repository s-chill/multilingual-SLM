The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus come in five new colors: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White and Black.

The iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus use an Apple A18 system on a chip . The chip is optimized for running Generative artificial intelligence and features a Neural Engine that is twice as fast as its predecessor.

The iPhone 16 includes an updated 48-megapixel Fusion camera, the same resolution as the iPhone 15 , with 2 μm, quad pixel PDAF, sensor-shift OIS, 100% Focus Pixels, support for super-high-resolution photos (24MP and 48MP).

All ‌iPhone 16‌ models have an improved thermal design. The main logic board has been updated, centralizing chip placement and optimizing the surrounding architecture. The recycled aluminum substructure dissipates heat for up to 30 percent higher sustained performance for gaming.

Every model in the iPhone 16 lineup has support for WiFi 7 .

The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus now come with the Action Button, first featured on the iPhone 15 Pro lineup. By default, the Action Button toggles silent mode. However, users can change the button's feature to do different things other than silent mode, like open the Camera app or toggle a focus mode.

All iPhone 16 models now come with a new button called Camera Control. This button is on the right side of the device, and allows the user to open the camera app, switch between different camera controls and features, and taking photos and videos. The button can distinguish between light and hard presses. By pressing the button once, it opens the camera app. By lightly pressing it twice, it opens a small menu with different camera controls, such as zoom or tone. And if you press it hard once, it takes a photo. If you hold it for a few seconds, it starts a video.
