Wild Oceans , founded in 1973 by fishermen as the National Coalition for Marine Conservation (NCMC), is the United States's oldest public advocacy group dedicated exclusively to conserving ocean fish and their environment .   Wild Oceans' mission is to build awareness of the threats to USA marine fisheries and convince policy-makers to restore and protect publicly owned fishery resources.  Its efforts focus on stopping overfishing , reducing bykill caused by indiscriminate fishing gear, and stemming the loss of critical marine habitat .

Wild Oceans' five program areas are:

The organization maximizes its conservation efforts by teaming up with other groups such as local fishing clubs and national environmental organizations.  Wild Oceans has been a leader in efforts to stop shark finning in all US waters; implement longline area closures to reduce the bykill of large pelagic fish ; implement a pro-active fishery management plan for dolphin and wahoo ; protect sargassum (critical habitat for pelagics) from commercial exploitation ; and implement measures to conserve populations of overfished blue and white marlin .

Wild Oceans is funded by private foundations and individual members.  Members include conservation-minded fishermen , scientists , divers , boaters, fishing clubs and associations, and wildlife enthusiasts.
