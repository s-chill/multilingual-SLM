The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society ( TMS ) is a professional organization for materials scientists and engineers that encompasses the entire range of materials and engineering, from minerals processing and primary metals production to basic research and the advanced applications of materials.

The society's functions include providing forums for the exchange of information; encouraging technology transfer; promoting the education and development of professionals and students; representing the profession in the accreditation of educational programs and in the registration of professional engineers (a U.S.-grounded activity); encouraging professionalism, ethical behavior, and concern for the environment; and stimulating a worldwide sense of unity in the profession.

TMS is headquartered in Pittsburgh, United States, but is international in scope. Included among its approximately 13,000 professional and student members are metallurgical and materials engineers, scientists, researchers, educators, and administrators from more than 70 countries on six continents. It uses a volunteer driven structure with members serving at all levels of the society including shaping the policy, programming, and publications of the society.

The society comprises five technical divisions to program conferences, develop content for publications, and perform other activities:

TMS is a major publisher in the materials community. The society publishes seven internationally respected technical journals, as well as multiple influential roadmapping studies and reports. In addition, each year the society publishes numerous proceedings volumes containing papers presented at society-sponsored meetings.

TMS has developed influential technology and/or roadmapping studies and reports convening experts in the minerals, metals, and materials communities. These publications are made freely accessible to the public.
