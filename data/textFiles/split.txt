split is a utility on Unix , Plan 9 , and Unix-like operating systems most commonly used to split a computer file into two or more smaller files.

The split command first appeared in Version 3 Unix and is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX.1 and the Single Unix Specification . The version of split bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Torbjorn Granlund and Richard Stallman . The split command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.

The command- syntax is:

The default behavior of split is to generate output files of a fixed size, default 1000 lines.  The files are named by appending aa , ab , ac , etc. to output filename .  If output filename is not given, the default filename of x is used, for example, xaa , xab , etc.  When a hyphen ( - ) is used instead of input filename , data is derived from standard input . The files are typically rejoined using a utility such as cat .

Additional program options permit a maximum character count (instead of a line count), a maximum line length, how many incrementing characters in generated filenames, and whether to use letters or digits.

Create a file named " myfile.txt " with exactly 3,000 lines of data:

Now, use the split command to break this file into pieces (note: unless otherwise specified, split will break the file into 1,000-line files):

As seen above, the split command has broken the original file (keeping the original intact) into three, equal in number of lines (i.e., 1,000), files: xaa , xab , and xac .
