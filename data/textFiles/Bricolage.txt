Bricolage was a content management system (CMS) written in the Perl programming language.

Bricolage was described as an Enterprise Class CMS , competitive in features and capability to high end, high cost proprietary products. Examples of organizations whose web sites use Bricolage include the World Health Organization , Rand Corporation , Macworld , and The Tyee .

Originally authored by David Wheeler to manage content for Salon.com , Bricolage is now maintained by a small group of core developers. Released under the revised BSD license , Bricolage is free and open source software .

Bricolage ran on the Apache web server on the Linux , BSD , Mac OS X and Solaris platforms. It can use either the PostgreSQL , MySQL and Oracle database management system and mod_perl .

Bricolage was inherently a multi user CMS, designed to manage workflow for large websites with many contributors. Bricolage uses a template development model and completely separates presentation from management of content.  The CMS did reside on a different server than the web site or other data store being managed.

Native PHP support was added in Bricolage 1.10, that embeds a PHP 5 interpreter inside a Perl 5 interpreter. As a result, PHP code runs in a native PHP 5 environment, but can also transparently make use of any and all Perl libraries, including the complete Bricolage API.

The name is probably based on the noun bricolage , meaning "Something constructed using whatever was available at the time".
