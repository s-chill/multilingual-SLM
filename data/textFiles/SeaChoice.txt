SeaChoice is an environmental advocacy group based in Canada. Launched in 2006, SeaChoice was created to increase consumer awareness around seafood sustainability in Canada. For 10 years, its primary goal was shifting seafood procurement to more sustainable options, with a focus on seafood suppliers and Canadian retailers. Having made significant progress in the retail landscape between 2006 and 2016, with many of their retail partners meeting their sustainable seafood commitments, SeaChoice set a new goal to increase sustainability throughout the entire seafood supply chain, from water to table.

SeaChoice is a partnership among the David Suzuki Foundation , Ecology Action Centre , and Living Oceans Society . Each conservation organization is also a member of the Conservation Alliance for Seafood Solutions and works with consumers, retailers, suppliers, government and producers to accomplish their objectives.
