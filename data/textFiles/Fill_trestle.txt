A fill trestle or filling trestle is a temporary construction trestle that is built to provide a scaffolding for the placement of fill or an earthen dam . Typically, the trestle is built across the valley and a railway is laid across the trestle. Specially designed side-dumping railroad cars filled with earth or gravel are pushed onto it and dumped, burying the trestle. Typically, a fill trestle is constructed out of wood which remains buried in the fill and eventually decomposes . Advances in construction technology, particularly the development of the dump truck , have rendered the fill trestle technique obsolete.
