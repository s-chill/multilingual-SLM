Findon is a coastal village along the North Sea in the area historically known as Kincardineshire . Somewhat to the south of Findon is the small offshore island of May Craig .

The local area was first recorded in medieval history in association with the Causey Mounth .  Findon is situated somewhat east of the ancient Causey Mounth trackway , which road was constructed on high ground to make passable this only available medieval route from coastal points south from Stonehaven to Aberdeen . This ancient passage specifically connected the River Dee crossing (where the present Bridge of Dee is situated) via Portlethen Moss , Muchalls Castle and Stonehaven to the south. The route was that taken by William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal and the Marquess of Montrose when they led a Covenanter army of 9,000 men in the battle of the Civil War in 1639.
