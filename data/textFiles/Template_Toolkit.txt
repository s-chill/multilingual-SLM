The Template Toolkit (TT) is a template engine used primarily for building web sites, but is also suitable for creating any type of digital document , such as a PDF or LaTeX file. Template Toolkit is based on a mini-language and does not allow direct Perl in its templates by default, unlike some competing products (e.g. Mason). This forces developers to separate business logic into Perl libraries , leaving only presentation logic in their templates. It is written in Perl , with some popular accessories in C . It is released under a free software licence ( Perl Artistic Licence or GPL ).

TT is used as a templating system for various Perl application frameworks, including the Catalyst MVC Framework , CGI::Application and the Maypole framework .

The Template Toolkit was written by Andy Wardley. The "prototype" for TT (the Text::MetaText Perl module) was released in 1996.  The first version of TT proper was released in 1999. Version 2.00 a.k.a. TT2 was released in 2001. A revised and revamped TT3 was in development, but appears abandoned. In the meantime, TT2 is steadily improved and has been released as version 3 late 2019.
