The Utah Department of Transportation ( UDOT ) is an agency of the state government of Utah , United States; it is usually referred to by its initials UDOT (pronounced "you-dot"). UDOT is charged with maintaining approximately 6,000 miles (9,700Â km) of roadway that constitute the network of state highways in Utah. The agency is headquartered in the Calvin L. Rampton State Office Complex in Taylorsville , Utah.

The Executive Director is Carlos Braceras with Lisa Wilson and Ben Huot as Deputy Directors. Project priorities are set forth by the independent Utah Transportation Commission , which coordinates directly with the UDOT. UDOT's three strategic goals include: Zero Fatalities, Optimize Mobility, and Preserve Infrastructure.

UDOT employs just under 1,800 people across the state. The department is divided into four geographically defined regions and 10 functional groups: Project Development, Operations, Program Development, Transit and Trails, Technology and Innovation, Employee Development, Communications, Policy and Legislative Services, Audit, and Finance. The agency has 88 maintenance stations throughout the state which are grouped into four administrative regions.

Originally, the State Road Commission of Utah, created in 1909, was responsible for maintenance, but these duties were rolled into the new Department of Transportation effective July 1, 1975.
