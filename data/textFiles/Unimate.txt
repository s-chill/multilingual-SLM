Unimate was the first industrial robot , which worked on a General Motors assembly line at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in Ewing Township, New Jersey , in 1961 .

It was invented by George Devol in the 1950s using his original patent filed in 1954 and granted in 1961 ( U.S. patent 2,988,237 ). The patent begins:

The present invention relates to the automatic operation of machinery, particularly the handling apparatus, and to automatic control apparatus suited for such machinery.

Devol, together with Joseph Engelberger , his business associate, started the world's first robot manufacturing company, Unimation .

The machine weighed 4000 pounds and undertook the job of transporting die castings from an assembly line and welding these parts on auto bodies, a dangerous task for workers, who might be poisoned by toxic fumes or lose a limb if they were not careful.

The original Unimate consisted of a large computer-like box, joined to another box and was connected to an arm, with systematic tasks stored in a drum memory .

In 2003 the Unimate was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame .

The Unimate appeared on The Tonight Show hosted by Johnny Carson on  which it knocked a golf ball into a cup, poured a beer, waved the orchestra conductor's baton and grasped an accordion and waved it around.

Fictional robots called Unimate , designed by the character Alan von Neumann, Jr. , appeared in comic books from DC Comics .
