The Moura Photovoltaic Power Station (also known as Amareleja Photovoltaic Power Station ) is a large photovoltaic power station in Amareleja , in the municipality of Moura , Portugal. It is one of the largest power stations of its kind, and is built in one of the sunniest regions in Europe. Its construction involved two stages: stage 1 was completed in 2008 after 13 months, and stage 2 was completed in 2010. The entire project exceeded a total cost of € 250 million.

Stage 2 of the project involved the construction of a further 20 MW of solar panels. It occupies an area of 618 acres (250 ha), and is capable of producing 93 GWh of electrical energy annually (10 MW average - equivalent to the electricity consumption of 15,000 Europeans).

The power station has an installed capacity of 62 MWp , with more than 376,000 solar panels . Approximately 190,000 panels (32 MW) are fitted on fixed structures, and 52,000 panels (10 MW) are fixed on single-axis trackers .

A €7.6 million solar panel factory, located in Moura, was constructed by Acciona , which provided panels for Stage 2 of the station construction. Its future production is targeted at the international market, with a capacity of producing 24 MW of solar panels annually.
