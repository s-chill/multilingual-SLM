Semapedia was a project that used Data Matrix nodes to connect Wikipedia articles with their relevant place in physical space.

Placing physical Semapedia tags on real-world objects allowed people with mobile phones to use their built-in cameras to decode the Wikipedia URL from the Semacode. The phone could then use its internal browser to display the Wikipedia article about the physical object to the user.

The maintainers of the site have since closed down due to the more publicized QRpedia fulfilling a similar role. It remains the first major attempt to organize phone code scanning for Wikipedia articles.
