David F. Marquardt (born February 1, 1949) was a co-founder of venture capital firm August Capital in 1995.  He has served on more than 35 boards of directors during his 40-year venture capital career including Microsoft , Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle), Seagate , Adaptec , and Grand Junction Networks (acquired by Cisco ).

Prior to August Capital, Marquardt was a co-founder of Technology Venture Investors (TVI) in 1980 where he was involved in four highly successful funds that invested in more than 100 start-up and emerging growth companies. Among these early investments was Microsoft, where TVI was the sole investor and where Marquardt served on the board of directors from 1981 until 2014. However, Microsoft did not need the venture capital investment and took on TVI in preparation for going public.

Marquardt has been involved in every phase of the entrepreneurial process from seed investments to classic venture financings, mergers & acquisitions, public offerings and restructuring & privatizations.

Marquardt began his venture career at Institutional Venture Associates, where he spent a year after graduating from business school.
