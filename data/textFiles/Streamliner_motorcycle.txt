A streamlined motorcycle is a motorcycle with a fairing that goes beyond a 'full' or 'dustbin' fairing, to form an aerodynamic shell to minimize drag . This helps attaining higher top speeds, as in the motorcycle land-speed record , or increased energy efficiency , as in the Craig Vetter Fuel Economy Challenge .  Often they are feet forwards motorcycles or have the rider in a prone position, rather than upright, to reduce the frontal area exposed to headwind.
