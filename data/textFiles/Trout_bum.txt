Trout bum is an affectionate nickname for dedicated trout anglers, particularly those who practice fly fishing .  Use of the term is similar in tone and meaning to the antiquated term, "Surf bum".  The term was popularized by author John Gierach , whose early work, Trout Bum is an anthology of informal, narrative essays on flyfishing; and magazine articles he wrote before 1986.

Fly Rod and Reel Magazine hosts an annual "trout bum" tournament dedicated to the pursuit of as many trout species as a two-man team of anglers can catch on a budget of only $500.
