Beginning with the Industrial Revolution era, a workshop may be a room , rooms or building which provides both the area and tools (or machinery ) that may be required for the manufacture or repair of manufactured goods . Workshops were the only places of production until the advent of industrialization and the development of larger factories . In the 20th and 21st century, many Western homes contained a workshop in either the garage, basement, or an external shed . Home workshops typically contain a workbench, hand tools, power tools, and other hardware. Along with the practical application of repairing goods, workshops are often used to tinker and make prototypes .

Some workshops focus exclusively on automotive repair or restoration although there are a variety of workshops in existence today.  Woodworking, metalworking, electronics, and other types of electronic prototyping workshops are among the most common.

In some repair industries, such as locomotives and aircraft , the repair operations have specialized workshops called back shops or railway workshops . Most repairs are carried out in small workshops, except where an industrial service is needed.
