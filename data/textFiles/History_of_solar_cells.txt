In the 19th century, it was observed that the sunlight striking certain materials generates detectable electric current â€“ the photoelectric effect . This discovery laid the foundation for solar cells . Solar cells have gone on to be used in many applications. They have historically been used in situations where electrical power from the grid was unavailable.

As the invention was brought out it made solar cells as a prominent utilization for power generation for satellites. Satellites orbit the Earth, thus making solar cells a prominent source for power generation through the sunlight falling on them. Solar cells are commonly  used in satellites in today's times.
