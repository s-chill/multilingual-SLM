A plank is timber that is flat, elongated, and rectangular with parallel faces that are higher and longer than wide. Used primarily in carpentry , planks are critical in the construction of ships , houses , bridges , and many other structures. Planks also serve as supports to form shelves and tables .

Usually made from sawed timber, planks are usually more than 1 + 1 ⁄ 2 in (38 mm) thick, and are generally wider than 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 in (64 mm). In the United States, planks can be any length and are generally a minimum of 2×8 ( 1 + 1 ⁄ 2 in × 7 + 1 ⁄ 4 in or 38 mm × 184 mm), but planks that are 2×10 ( 1 + 1 ⁄ 2 in × 9 + 1 ⁄ 4 in or 38 mm × 235 mm) and 2×12 ( 1 + 1 ⁄ 2 in × 11 + 1 ⁄ 4 in or 38 mm × 286 mm) are more commonly stocked by lumber retailers. Planks are often used as a work surface on elevated scaffolding , and need to be wide enough to provide strength without breaking when walked on. The wood is categorized as a board if its width is less than 2 + 1 ⁄ 2 in (64 mm), and its thickness is less than 1 + 1 ⁄ 2 in (38 mm).

A plank used in a building as a horizontal supporting member that runs between foundations, walls, or beams to support a ceiling or floor is called a joist .

The plank was the basis of maritime transport : wood floats on water , and abundant forests meant wooden logs could be easily obtained and processed, making planks the primary material in ship building . However, since the 20th century, wood has largely been supplanted in ship construction by iron and steel , to decrease cost and improve durability.
