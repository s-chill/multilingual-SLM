Timeline of sustainable energy research 2020â€“ documents increases in renewable energy , solar energy , and nuclear energy , particularly for ways that are sustainable within the Solar System .

Events currently not included in the timelines include:

Ongoing research and development projects include SSPS-OMEGA , SPS-ALPHA , and the Solaris program .

Research about sustainable energy in general or across different types.

Research and development of (technical) means to substantially or systematically reduce need for energy beyond smart grids, education / educational technology (such as about differential environmental impacts of diets), transportation infrastructure (bicycles and rail transport) and conventional improvements of energy efficiency on the level of the energy system.

Maintenance of sustainable energy systems could be automated , standardized and simplified and the required resources and efforts for such get reduced via research relevant for their design and processes like waste management .
