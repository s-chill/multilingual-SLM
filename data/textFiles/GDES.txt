In cryptography , the Generalized DES Scheme ( GDES or G-DES ) is a variant of the DES symmetric-key block cipher designed with the intention of speeding up the encryption process while improving its security. The scheme was proposed by Ingrid Schaumuller-Bichl in 1981.

In 1990, Eli Biham and Adi Shamir showed that GDES was vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis , and that any GDES variant faster than DES is also less secure than DES.

GDES generalizes the Feistel network structure of DES to larger block sizes . In each round, the DES round function is applied to the rightmost 32-bit subblock, and the result is XORed with all the other parts. Then the block is rotated 32 bits to the right.
