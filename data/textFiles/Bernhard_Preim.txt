In June 2002, he received the Habilitation degree (venia legendi) for computer science from the University of Bremen . Since Mars 2003 he is full professor for "Visualization" at the computer science department at the Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg, heading a research group which is focussed on medical visualization and applications in surgical education and surgery planning. These developments are summarized in a comprehensive textbook Visualization in Medicine (Co-author Dirk Bartz ), which appeared at Morgan Kaufmann in June 2007.
Bernhard Preim was founding speaker of the working group Medical Visualization in the German Society for Computer Science (2003–2012). He is the chair of the scientific advisory board of ICCAS and since 2013 president of the CURAC (German Society for Computer- and Roboter-assisted Surgery, [1] ) and Visiting Professor at the University of Bremen where he closely collaborates with MeVis Research (now Fraunhofer MEVIS ).
