Within the community of Apple users and developers, Federighi is known for his energetic presentations of new Apple software, frequently featuring absurdist humor such as references to his hair, use of new software features to organize events such as office karaoke parties and camping trips, and his claimed love of the band Rush . A running gag in Federighi's macOS presentations involves him describing the fictional exploits of the “crack product marketing team”, venturing naked through California in a Volkswagen Minibus and ultimately arriving at the location after which the version of the operating system is named. Federighi has some notable nicknames around Apple, such as "Hair Force One". Additionally, Apple CEO Tim Cook has called him "Superman".

At WWDC 2016, Federighi introduced iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 "Sierra" and said that the 15-year-old OS X would be rebranded as "macOS" in tune with the naming scheme used for iOS , tvOS , and watchOS . He emphasized the use of widgets on the iOS lock screen and announced new APIs for Siri and iMessage that would be open to all developers. In March 2016, Federighi wrote an article for The Washington Post stating that "I became an engineer because I believe in the power of technology to enrich our lives" as his motivation.

At an Apple Special Event in September 2017, Federighi initially failed to properly demo the Face ID feature on the iPhone X .
