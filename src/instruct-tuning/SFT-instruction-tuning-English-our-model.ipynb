    "## Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapted from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXevvEF3QVI&ab_channel=NielsRogge (author: Niels Rogge)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that creating a ChatGPT at home involves 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pre-training a large language model (LLM) to predict the next token on internet-scale data, on clusters of thousands of GPUs. One calls the result a \"base model\"\n",
    "2. supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to turn the base model into a useful assistant\n",
    "3. human preference fine-tuning which increases the assistant's friendliness, helpfulness and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to illustrate step 2. This involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT for short), also called instruction tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised fine-tuning takes in a \"base model\" from step 1, i.e. a model that has been pre-trained on predicting the next token on internet text, and turns it into a \"chatbot\"/\"assistant\". This is done by fine-tuning the model on human instruction data, using the cross-entropy loss. This means that the model is still trained to predict the next token, although we now want the model to generate useful completions given an instruction like \"what are 10 things to do in London?\", \"How can I make pancakes?\" or \"Write me a poem about elephants\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, one requires human annotators to collect useful completions, on which we can train the model. OpenAI for instance [hired human contractors for this](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-openai-ai-contractors-15-dollars-per-hour-1850415474), which were asked to generate useful completions given instructions, like \"In London, you can visit the Big Ben and (...)\". A nice collection of openly available SFT datasets can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/awesome-sft-datasets-65788b571bf8e371c4e4241a).\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the model becomes more useful: rather than simply predicting the next token (which might give undesirable outputs, like generating follow-up questions rather than answering the question), we now make it more likely that the model will output useful completions for any instruction we give it. We basically steer it in the direction of generating useful completions which a human could have written given any instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the entire notebook is based on and can be seen as an annotated version of the [Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook) developed by Hugging Face, and more specifically the [recipe](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/blob/main/recipes/zephyr-7b-beta/sft/config_lora.yaml) used to train Zephyr-7b-beta. Huge kudos to the team for creating this!\n",
    "* this notebook applies to any decoder-only LLM available in the Transformers library. In this notebook, we are going to fine-tune the [Mistral-7B base model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1), which is one of the best open-source large language models at the time of writing."

      "Challenges of Blockchain-based Voting Systems\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the numerous benefits that blockchain-based voting systems offer, they still face considerable impediments that need to be addressed. These include scalability, privacy concerns, and the risk of hacking. Blockchain technology in itself can be slow, and with the increasing number of voters, scalability can be a significant challenge. Privacy concerns also arise due to the traceability of every transaction on the blockchain, compromising voter confidentiality.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate these issues, various potential solutions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Scalability - the adoption of off-chain protocols, sharding, and sidechains to increase the blockchain's processing speed and reduce congestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Anonymity- Implementing anonymous, zero-knowledge proof, and other privacy protocols in blockchain-based voting systems to strengthen privacy while still maintaining transparency and accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Information security -  employing different layers of encryption and the use of multi-factor authentication in the voter's identity verification process. \n",
      "\n",
      " Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering the increase in the adoption of digital solutions and the great benefits that blockchain-based voting systems offer, it is apparent that this is the path to follow to enhance the security and transparency of the voting process. With a suitable approach to tackle scalability, privacy concerns, and security, these systems would provide significant contributions towards enhancing democratic processes.<|eot_id|>\n",
      "<|user|>\n",
      "This is a great overview of blockchain-based voting systems, thank you! Could you please add more information about the potential benefits of using blockchain in voting systems, such as reducing voter fraud or increasing voter turnout?<|eot_id|>\n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Certainly! One of the primary benefits of blockchain-based voting systems is their potential to reduce voter fraud. Because the blockchain is a decentralized and immutable ledger, it makes it difficult for anyone to alter or manipulate voting records. The distributed nature of blockchain technology makes it difficult for any party to control the voting process, retaining the integrity of the election, and reducing the risk of fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, blockchain-based voting systems also have the potential to increase voter turnout. Digital voting processes could allow individuals to vote from anywhere in the world, improving access to the voting process. These systems could enable citizens to vote remotely, without the need to visit polling stations physically, saving time and travel costs associated with traditional voting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, blockchain technology can facilitate the verification and counting of ballots. With blockchain, the system can automatically count and verify votes more quickly and accurately than traditional methods. The system can also notify all parties concerned, such as candidates, media, and observers, about the results instantly, minimizing the time waiting for a vote count and fostering transparency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, blockchain-based voting systems also offer robust security mechanisms that maintain the confidentiality, privacy, and security of the voter's identity, reducing the risk of electoral fraud or coercion. These mechanisms include public-key encryption, multi-factor authentication, and cryptographic hashing to eliminate unwanted access and retain voter anonymity while guaranteeing electoral transparency and audit trail. \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, blockchain-based voting systems can enhance the transparency, security, privacy, and accuracy of democratic elections, thus improving the democratic process and increasing voter confidence in electoral outcomes.<|eot_id|>\n",
      "<|user|>\n",
      "Can you please provide some real-life examples of how blockchain-based voting systems have already been used in elections or other democratic processes?<|eot_id|>\n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Sure, here are some examples of blockchain-based voting systems that have been used in recent elections or other democratic processes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sierra Leone: In March 2018, Sierra Leone became the first country to use blockchain in their presidential election. The government used blockchain-based voting system to tally the votes, while also using conventional paper ballots. The technology ensured the transparency of the election results, and the blockchain-based tally matched the manual count. 2. Moscow, Russia: In September 2019, the city of Moscow in Russia tested a blockchain-based voting system for the city council election. Moscow Department of Information Technology (DIT) developed the technology to record voting data and count ballots. Despite allegations that the system was rigged, the DIT insisted that the system was tamper-proof and provided more transparency than traditional voting methods. 3. West Virginia, USA: In May 2018, the US state of West Virginia used blockchain-based voting for their primary election. The platform, developed by Voatz, allowed military personnel overseas to cast their votes via mobile devices securely. The system eliminated a significant barrier for military personnel to vote, considering they were deployed to different time zones and locations worldwide. 4. South Korea: South Korea used a blockchain-based voting system for the National Election Committee in 2020. The system used biometric verification of voters and recorded the voting data on the blockchain to ensure transparency and security. 5. Tsinghua University, China: In 2019, Tsinghua University in China held student government elections using a blockchain-based voting system. The system aimed to address the risk of fraud and ensure the integrity of the election results. These real-life examples demonstrate the potential of blockchain-based voting systems, such as enhanced transparency, security, and efficiency, and highlights how they can be used to improve democratic processes worldwide.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "This is fascinating information about blockchain-based voting systems. Could you please provide more detailed information on the potential security risks associated with blockchain-based voting systems and how they can be mitigated?<|eot_id|>\n",
      "<|assistant|>\n",
      "Certainly! Despite the many advantages of blockchain-based voting systems, they still face certain security risks that need to be mitigated to ensure the integrity of the electoral process. Here are some potential security risks and the ways to mitigate them:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 51% Attack: In typical blockchain systems, 51% of the network's computing power is required to confirm a transaction. In the case of voting, this means that attackers can manipulate the outcome by amassing 51% of the network's processing power. To mitigate this risk, blockchain-based voting systems can use a hybrid system where both traditional and blockchain-based voting systems are used simultaneously, providing failover mechanisms to prevent manipulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Malware and Hacking: Blockchain-based voting systems can attract hackers who may try to manipulate or erase records, causing voter disenfranchisement or tampering of the election outcome. To mitigate the risk, blockchain-based voting systems can leverage several security mechanisms such as biometric authentication, two-factor authentication, and multi-signature accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Vulnerability of Smart Contracts: A significant portion of blockchain-based voting systems runs on smart contracts, which are self-executing programs that ensure the integrity of a transaction. However, smart contracts can have vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. To mitigate the risk of smart contract vulnerability, developers can write code that is highly secure and undergoes rigorous testing and validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Voter Identity: The voter’s identity is vital in maintaining the integrity of an election. However, identity theft and fraud can compromise the electoral process. To reduce the risk, blockchain-based voting systems can leverage identity verification mechanisms such as biometric data or digital signatures, protecting user privacy while ensuring the authenticity of the identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Centralized Control: While blockchain-based voting systems are decentralized, they are still susceptible to centralization by private entities. This means that parties controlling the majority of the system can manipulate, breach, or withhold the vote from the system. To mitigate this risk, blockchain-based voting systems should incorporate transparency and audit mechanisms that allow independent parties to verify the authenticity of the election results.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, by mitigating the potential security risks associated with blockchain-based voting systems through sound systems design, robust security mechanisms, and transparent operations, these systems can provide higher integrity, trust, and transparency in electoral processes.<|eot_id|>\n",

      "Of course, here are some tips for making extra flaky pastry:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Keep your butter cold - this is crucial for creating flaky pastry. Cut the butter into small pieces and place it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before making the pastry.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Use a combination of butter and shortening - shortening can help make the pastry more tender and flaky. Try using half butter and half shortening in your pastry recipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Don't overwork the dough - handle the dough as little as possible to prevent overworking it. Overworking the dough will cause the butter to warm up and prevent the pastry from becoming flaky.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Use ice-cold water - like with the butter, cold ingredients are key. Use ice-cold water when making the dough. And if you can, chill the mixing bowl and utensils too.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Use the right flour - pastry flour or all-purpose flour both work well for flaky pastry. Avoid using bread flour, which has a higher protein content and can make the pastry tough.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Chill the dough - chilling the dough before rolling it out and again after lining the pie dish can help prevent shrinking and maintain flakiness.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, it's time to define the model arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, some explanation is required regarding ways to fine-tune model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, one performs \"full fine-tuning\": this means that we will simply update all the weights of the base model during fine-tuning. This is then typically done either in full precision (float32), or mixed precision (a combination of float32 and float16). However, with ever larger models like LLMs, this becomes infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, float32 means that each parameter of a model gets saved in 32 bits or 4 bytes. Hence, for a 7 billion parameter model like Mistral-7B, one requires 7 billion parameters \\* 4 bytes per parameter = 28 GB of GPU RAM, just to load the model. During training with an optimizer like AdamW, one not only requires memory for the model but also for the gradients and optimizer states, which roughly comes down to approximately 18 times the size of the model in gigabytes when training with mixed precision, in this case 7 * 18 = 126 GB of GPU RAM. And that's just for a 7B parameter model! See the guide for more info: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.1/en/perf_train_gpu_one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRa, a PEFT method\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, some clever people at Microsoft have come up with a method called [LoRa](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/conceptual_guides/lora) (low-rank adaptation). The idea here is that, rather than performing full fine-tuning, we are going to freeze the existing model and only add a few parameter weights to the model (called \"adapters\"), which we're going to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRa is what we call a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. It's a popular method for fine-tuning models in a parameter-efficient way, by only training a few adapters, keeping the existing model untouched. LoRa is available in the [PEFT library](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.7.1/en/index) by Hugging Face, which also supports various other PEFT methods (but LoRa is the most popular one at the time of writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "### QLoRa, an even more efficient method\n",
    "\n",
    "With regular LoRa, one would keep the base model in 32 or 16 bits in memory, and then train the parameter weights. However, there have been new methods developed to shrink the size of a model considerably, to 8 or 4 bits per parameter (we call this [\"quantization\"](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization)). Hence, if we apply LoRa to a quantized model (like a 4-bit model), then we call this QLoRa. We have a [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) that tells you all about it. There are various quantization methods available, here we're going to use the [BitsandBytes](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization#transformers.BitsAndBytesConfig) integration.\n"
