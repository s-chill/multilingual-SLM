"Google Docs was launched in 2006. It originated from Writely, a web-based word processor that was developed by the software company Upstartle, which was founded by Steve Newman and Steve McMillan. In 2006, Google acquired Upstartle and launched Google Docs as a product under its own brand. The service was initially available as an invitation-only beta product. It was officially released to the public in November 2009."
"In the context of early personal computers, the term ""monitor"" originally referred to the CRT display itself, rather than any electronic device that controlled what was shown on the screen. Thus, a monitor was a completely passive device, containing only the CRT, the associated circuitry to drive it, and the necessary connectors to interface with a computer. This was in contrast to the later ""monitoring"" or ""supervising"" role of a display in some later computer systems, where the display could be driven by a separate card in the computer, and could be programmed to indicate the status of the system or its peripherals. In the early days, the monitor was a completely separate box from the computer, and was not connected to it except by the video cable. This was because the computer was not powerful enough to drive a CRT directly, and the monitor was needed to provide the necessary power and the necessary electronic interface to convert the computer's video signal into one that the monitor could understand. This was also the case for the monitor's control buttons, which were part of the monitor, and not part of the computer. The monitor was a completely standalone device, and the computer could be shut down and unplugged from it, without affecting the monitor in any way. The monitor would remain on, and would continue to display the last image shown on it, until it was shut down by its control buttons. This was the common way for monitors to be used, until the early 1990s, when LCD monitors became common. LCD monitors do not have the same power requirements as CRT monitors, and do not need an external power source, and are connected to the computer by a digital video cable, rather than an analog one. This is why LCD monitors are not considered to be ""monitor"" in the original sense of the word."
The IBM 5100 was introduced in 1975.

"The PageRank algorithm was developed by Larry Page and Brin Sergey, both students at Stanford University, in 1998. It was initially described in a research paper by them titled ""The PageRank Citation Ranking: Brining Order to the Web"" in 1998. The paper introduced the concept of link analysis to the field of computer science and was published at the 15th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management. Page and Brin eventually dropped out of their PhD program to start Google. The algorithm was later refined and commercialized by Google."
"In 2004, Google took the following initial steps to manage the infrastructure for Gmail's beta release:

1.  Building a massive data center: Google built a massive data center in the Bay Area, with 30,000 servers. This was the largest server deployment in the world at that time.
2.  Developing the necessary software: Google developed the necessary software to support the massive scale of the data center. This included developing the Linux-based Google File System, the MapReduce data processing framework, and the Bigtable distributed database.
3.  Creating the necessary network infrastructure: Google built a 1,000-mile fiber optic cable ring connecting the data center to its other data centers and to the Internet.
4.  Developing the necessary partnerships: Google developed partnerships with major ISPs to provide transit and peering services.
5.  Creating the necessary user interface: Google developed the user interface for Gmail, which was based on the Google Mail user interface, and added the necessary features for the beta release.

The effect of these initial steps on user interest was that it created a lot of buzz and interest in Gmail. The beta release was a huge success, and Gmail became the most popular email service in the world. This was because of the large amount of free space that was provided, the powerful search engine, and the innovative features like the threaded conversations. The success of Gmail also helped Google to gain a lot of revenue, as it provided a lot of targeted advertising. This was because Gmail was able to provide targeted advertising based on the content of the emails. This was a new concept at the time, and it was very successful.

"The decline of traditional arcades in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to changes in the types of entertainment offered by arcade establishments. As the popularity of home consoles and personal computers grew, many arcades closed or transformed into other entertainment venues. This led to the rise of amusement-based arcades, which incorporated games and entertainment options beyond just video games. Some of these options include: 

1. Redemption games: These games dispensed tickets or tokens that could be redeemed for prizes. This drew in customers looking for a fun experience rather than just playing video games. Examples of these games include crane machines, claw machines, and arcade games like The Incredible Machine 2. 
2. Amusement games: These games were often based on physical skills like air hockey, foosball, pool, and pinball. These games were often found in bars and other adult-oriented establishments. 
3. Interactive games: These games used physical movement and interaction with the game to control the game. Examples include Dance Dance Revolution, GuitarFreak and its sequels, and arcade racing games like Initial D. 
4. Virtual reality games: As VR technology became more affordable for arcades, some arcades began to incorporate VR games. This provided a unique experience for players and drew in customers looking for a new type of entertainment. 
5. Food and drink: Many arcades began incorporating food and drink options. This could be as simple as a snack stand or as elaborate as a full restaurant. This drew in customers looking for a place to eat and play. 
6. Karaoke: Karaoke games like SingStar and GuitarFreak were popular on consoles and were also found in arcades. These games were often found in bars and other adult-oriented establishments. 
7. Prize games: These games dispensed prizes based on the player's skill. This could be anything from a simple stuffed animal to a car. Examples include crane machines, claw machines, and arcade games like The Incredible Machine 2. 
8. Novelty games: These games were often based on a unique or unusual control mechanism. Examples include arcade games like Eye of the Tiger and arcade claw machines like the Claw. 
9. Interactive art installations: As video games became more advanced, some arcades began incorporating interactive art installations. These could include anything from a simple light-based installation to a full virtual reality experience. Examples include the art installations found in the Taito Station and the arcade games like The Path. 
10. Esports: As competitive video games became more popular, some arcades began to incorporate esports into their offerings. This could include anything from a simple tournament to a full esports arena. Examples include the esports arenas found in the Taito Station and the arcade games like Street Fighter IV."
"The use of proprietary software components in Android devices raises several challenges and criticisms. Some of these include: 

1.  **Security concerns**: The use of proprietary components raises the risk of security breaches. Since the source code of these components is not publicly available, it is difficult for independent security researchers to identify and fix vulnerabilities. Moreover, the use of proprietary components may lead to the introduction of malware and other security threats. For example, the Stagefright vulnerability, which was discovered in 2013, was a security flaw in the multimedia processing software that is common across most Android devices. It could be exploited to steal user data and passwords. Google was not aware of the vulnerability because the source code was proprietary. However, Google was able to work with the manufacturer to develop a patch. Nevertheless, the use of proprietary components may lead to a delay in the release of security patches. For example, the Exynos vulnerability, which was discovered in 2020, was a security flaw in the Exynos processors used in some Samsung devices. It could be exploited to steal user data and access the phone. Google was not aware of the vulnerability because the source code was proprietary. However, Google was able to work with Samsung to develop a patch. Nevertheless, the patch was released months after the discovery of the vulnerability. This delay may have allowed attackers to exploit the vulnerability. 

2.  **Lack of improvements**: Since the source code of proprietary components is not publicly available, independent developers cannot improve the performance of these components. For example, the Qualcomm Adreno GPUs used in most Android devices are not open-source. As a result, independent developers cannot improve the performance of these GPUs. Moreover, since the source code is not publicly available, it may be difficult for developers to identify and fix bugs in these components. For example, the Qualcomm Adreno GPUs have a known bug that causes the screen to flicker. However, since the source code is proprietary, it may be difficult for developers to identify the cause of the bug or to develop a fix. 

3.  **Lack of customization**: Since the source code of proprietary components is not publicly available, it may be difficult for developers to customize these components. For example, the proprietary components used in Android devices may not be optimized for the hardware used in these devices. As a result, the performance of these devices may not be as good as it could be if the source code were publicly available. 

4.  **Cost**: The use of proprietary components may increase the cost of Android devices. For example, the cost of a device with a Qualcomm processor is higher than the cost of a device with a Mediatek processor. This may be because Qualcomm has a larger market share than Mediatek. As a result, manufacturers of devices with Mediatek processors may not be able to increase the price of these devices as much as manufacturers of devices with Qualcomm processors. 

5.  **Lack of competition**: The use"
"Google took several actions to defend Android from patent litigation and expand its capabilities in response to competitive pressures from companies such as Apple, Oracle, and Microsoft. These actions can be summarized as follows:

**Defending Android from patent litigation:**

1. **Patent licensing:** Google formed the Open Handset Alliance (OHA) in 2007, a consortium of phone manufacturers and mobile carriers that agreed to cross-license each other's patents. This patent pool, which now includes over 250 members, has been very effective in defending Android against patent litigation. Almost all Android patent lawsuits have been filed by members of the OHA, and most of these lawsuits have been settled or lost by the plaintiff. For example, in 2011, Microsoft and Google settled their long-standing patent disputes, with Microsoft receiving an undisclosed amount of money and access to Google's patent library. Similarly, in 2014, Apple and Google settled their patent disputes, with Apple receiving an undisclosed amount of money and access to Google's patent library. In 2015, Google acquired Motorola Mobility from Google for $12.5 billion, which provided it with a large patent portfolio. This patent portfolio was used to defend Android against patent lawsuits. For example, in 2016, Google acquired the smartphone business of HTC for $1.1 billion, which provided it with additional patents. In 2020, Google acquired 17,000 patents from a company called Sonic patents for $1.1 billion. These patents were acquired to defend Android against patent lawsuits. In 2020, Google was sued by a company called Core Wireless for patent infringement. Google responded by filing a countersuit and also filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) against Core Wireless. In 2021, the ITC ruled in favor of Google. In 2022, the ITC ruled in favor of Core Wireless. Google is appealing this ruling. In 2022, Google filed a countersuit against Core Wireless. The outcome of this countersuit is pending. In 2022, Google filed a complaint with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) against Core Wireless for patent infringement. The outcome of this complaint is pending. In 2022, Google filed a complaint with the Federal Circuit for patent infringement against Core Wireless. The outcome of this complaint is pending. In 2022, Core Wireless filed a complaint with the Federal Circuit for patent infringement against Google. The outcome of this complaint is pending. In 2022, Core Wireless filed a complaint with the USPTO for patent infringement against Google. The outcome of this complaint is pending.

"The transition from first-generation to second-generation computers in the 1960s was led by significant technological advancements in the following areas:

1. **Integrated Circuits (ICs)**: The development of large-scale integrated (LSI) microchips led to the replacement of discrete transistors with ICs. This reduced the number of components, cost, and size, while increasing speed and reducing power consumption. The first commercial LSI was the Fairchild Semiconductor Four-Transistor MOS Memory Cell in 1968.
2. **Memory**: The development of solid-state memory (e.g., magnetic-core memory's replacement by semiconductor memory) further reduced the size and cost of computers. The first commercial semiconductor memory was the Intel 3000, a 64-kilobyte read-only memory (ROM) chip, released in 1970.
3. **Microprocessors**: The development of microprocessors, which contained the central processing unit (CPU) on a single IC, was the most significant event of the period. The first commercial microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released in 1971. This led to the development of minicomputers and personal computers in the 1970s.
4. **Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) technology**: The development of MOS technology, which replaced magnetic-core memory with silicon-based memory, further reduced the cost and size of computers. The first commercial MOS memory chip was the Intel 1101, a 1-kilobyte read-write memory (RRAM) chip, released in 1970.
5. **Improved circuit design**: The development of high-speed, low-power Schottky diodes and silicon diodes replaced older vacuum tube and germanium diode technology. The development of high-temperature superconductors led to the commercialization of superconductive magnetic resonance memory (MRAM) in 1974.
6. **Improved manufacturing techniques**: The development of photolithography and other semiconductor manufacturing techniques led to larger-scale integration (LSI) and very-large-scale integration (VLSI) chips, which further reduced the cost and size of computers.
7. **Computer-aided design (CAD) tools**: The development of computer-aided design tools for integrated circuit (IC) design, which allowed the design of ICs to be automated, further increased the speed and reduced the cost of IC design.
8. **Computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools**: The development of computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools for electronic design automation (EDA), which allowed the design of electronic devices to be automated, further increased the speed and reduced the cost of electronic device design.
9. **Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) tools**: The development of computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) tools, which allowed the design of integrated circuits to be manufactured on a large scale, further increased the speed and reduced the cost of electronic device design.

"In RISC OS, application directories serve two purposes. Firstly, they provide a location for applications to be installed to, thereby separating the installed applications from the operating system itself. Secondly, they provide a means for applications to be launched, by adding an application to the directory called ""dir"" in the main RISC OS directory. This directory is used by the GUI to find applications to launch. Applications are launched by double-clicking on them. The application's icon is displayed in the main RISC OS directory, and can be dragged to other directories for organisation purposes. The application's icon can also be dragged to the ""Menu' directory, which is used by the menu system to find menu items. Menu items are added to the menu by creating a menu item in the ""Menu' directory. Menu items can be sub-menus, or menu items with a command-line interface.

"One significant challenge faced by Eastern Bloc countries in developing their computer hardware industries was the lack of access to Western markets and the restrictions on importing Western technology. This made it difficult for them to stay up-to-date with technological advancements in the West and to obtain the components they needed to develop their own computers. They were able to overcome this to some extent by trading with non-Soviet Eastern European countries, but this was limited. They were also able to obtain some Western components through ""back channels"". This was a black market where individuals would smuggle components out of the West for sale in the East. This was risky for all parties involved as it was illegal and could result in severe punishment if detected. Despite these challenges, they were able to develop some notable computer hardware. For example, the Zilog Z80 CPU was developed in Czechoslovakia and was used in a number of Eastern Bloc computers. The R-20 disk drive was developed in Romania and was used on a number of Eastern Bloc computers. The Scanimate animation system was developed in Bulgaria and was used to animate a number of TV series. The Didaktik I educational computer was developed in Czechoslovakia and was one of the first educational computers. The Ripet computer was developed in Poland and was one of the first microprocessor based computers in the world. The SM EVA 2110 computer was developed in East Germany and was one of the first computers to use a bit serial to bit parallel data transfer scheme. The computer hardware developed in the Eastern Bloc was of a high quality and was able to compete with Western hardware. The computers were also able to use software developed in the West.

"In 2003, IBM sold its hard disk drive business to Hitachi, thereby exiting the HDD manufacturing market. This deal was valued at $2 billion and was completed in March 2009. At the time, HDDs were the main storage option for computers. IBM had been a leading manufacturer of HDDs since the 1950s. The company had developed many innovations in the field, including the first disk drive (1956), the first floppy disk drive (1971), the first thin-film head disk drive (1981), and the first 3 1 ⁄ 2 -inch drive (1986). IBM was also a pioneer in the development of disk formats, introducing the 8-inch FDD (1973), the 5 1 ⁄ 4 -inch FDD (1976), the 3 1 ⁄ 2 -inch FDD (1982), and the 3 1 ⁄ 2 -inch HDD (1986). In 2003, IBM was the world's second-largest manufacturer of HDDs, after Hitachi. The acquisition was part of Hitachi's strategy to become a major player in the computer industry. The deal was part of IBM's plan to refocus its hard disk drive business on high-end enterprise products. The acquisition was completed in March 2009."

"The introduction of microprocessors in the early 1970s had a profound impact on the development of personal computers. The microprocessor replaced the large, expensive, and difficult to produce discrete component (integrated circuit) mainframes that were the only previous options for personal computer users. The microprocessor was a central processing unit (CPU) contained on a single large-scale integration (LSI) MOS integrated circuit (IC) chip. This chip contained the arithmetic, logic, and control functions of a CPU. The microprocessor was essentially a complete CPU on a single chip. This made it possible to produce low-cost, simple, and easy to use personal computers. The microprocessor also enabled the development of solid-state memory (RAM) which was also contained on an LSI IC chip. This eliminated the bulky, costly, and power-hungry magnetic-core memory used in prior generations of computers. The combination of the microprocessor and solid-state memory made it possible to produce inexpensive, easy to use personal computers that were small, reliable, and simple to operate. This led to the development of the first personal computers. The Altair 8800 was introduced in 1975 and was based on the Intel 8080 microprocessor. The Altair was essentially a bare circuit board with no operating system or other software included. It was sold in kit form and the buyer was expected to assemble the machine themselves. The Altair was the first computer to be called a personal computer and it was the first computer to be widely covered in the press. It was followed by the Apple I computer in 1976 which was also based on the Intel 8080. The Apple I was the first computer to include an operating system and a monitor. The Apple I was followed by the Apple II in 1977 which was the first computer to include color graphics and a floppy disk drive. The Apple II was one of the three ""1977 Trinity"" computers that were credited with popularizing the personal computer market. The other two were the Commodore PET and the TRS-80. The ""1977 Trinity"" computers were the first computers to be aimed at the general public rather than at technical enthusiasts. They were designed to be easy to use and included a variety of software. They were also relatively inexpensive, the Apple II was priced at $1,298, the PET at $799, and the TRS-80 at $599. The ""1977 Trinity"" computers were the first computers to be widely used in homes and small businesses. They were followed by a number of other computers that were also aimed at the general public. The home computer market was a fast-growing market that was worth $3 billion by 1982. The home computer market was a key factor in the development of the IBM PC in the early 1980s. IBM had been developing the PC for three years before it was introduced in 1981. The PC was based on the Intel 8088 microprocessor"

"The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist at CERN. He proposed a ""universal linked information system"" in 1980, and, after developing the first web server and web browser, he made the system available to other researchers at CERN in 1990. The system was publicly released in 1991. Berners-Lee is credited with developing the fundamental technologies that made the Web possible, including the fundamental protocols for information exchange, such as HTTP, the first web server, and the first web browser. He also made the source code of the first web server, called httpd, available for public use. He was knighted in 2004 for his work on the web, and in 2009, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President Barack Obama for his work on the web."

"There are several types of Question Answering (QA) systems. Here are some of the main categories:

1. **Open-ended QA**: The system answers open-ended questions that do not have a fixed answer. For example, ""What is the meaning of life?"" or ""What are the benefits of using machine learning in healthcare?""

2. **Multiple Choice QA**: The system answers multiple-choice questions that have a fixed answer. For example, ""What is the capital of France?"" or ""Which of the following is the largest search engine?""

3. **Factoid QA**: The system answers factual questions that have a specific answer. For example, ""What is the birth year of Albert Einstein?"" or ""What is the chemical formula for water?""

4. **Natural Language QA**: The system answers questions written in natural language. For example, ""Who is the CEO of Google?"" or ""What is the definition of machine learning?""

5. **Textual QA**: The system answers questions based on text. For example, ""What is the main theme of the book To Kill a Mockingbird?"" or ""What are the main characters in the book To Kill a Mockingbird?""

6. **Conversational QA**: The system answers questions in a conversation. For example, ""What is the weather like today?"" and then ""What is the weather forecast for tomorrow?""

7. **Visual QA**: The system answers questions based on images or videos. For example, ""What is the object in the center of the picture?"" or ""What is happening in this video?""

8. **Multi-step QA**: The system answers questions that require multiple steps to answer. For example, ""What is the average temperature in New York City?"" and then ""What is the average temperature in Los Angeles?"" and finally ""What is the difference between the average temperature in New York City and the average temperature in Los Angeles?""

9. **Generation QA**: The system generates answers based on the input question. For example, ""Write a short story about a boy who likes to play soccer."" or ""Generate a poem about the beauty of nature.""

10. **Hybrid QA**: The system combines multiple types of QA. For example, it answers multiple-choice questions based on text or answers open-ended questions based on images.

These categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, a system that answers multiple-choice questions based on text can also be considered a hybrid system. The main purpose of this classification is to provide a framework for understanding the different types of QA systems."

"The 1990s saw the emergence of real-time 3D polygonal graphic rendering in both game consoles and PCs, thanks to the convergence of several technological and market factors. The most significant drivers were:

1. **Texture mapping**: In 1986, the first texture mapping extensions were introduced by Evans & Sutherland and SGI. This technique allowed the use of high-resolution bitmaps to be mapped onto 3D models, giving the illusion of detailed surfaces. By the early 1990s, texture mapping had become a standard feature in all high-end graphics workstations.
2. **Polygonal modeling**: The widespread adoption of polygonal mesh modeling in the early 1990s. This was made possible by the introduction of the SGI IRIS 1000 in 1988, which was the first graphics system to support polygonal mesh rendering. The SGI IRIS 1400, released in 1991, was the first graphics system to support polygonal rendering with texture mapping.
3. **Raster image display hardware**: The availability of high-resolution raster display hardware, such as the IBM 8514 and the SGI FX20, which provided the necessary screen space to display detailed 3D images.
4. **The rise of 3D computer graphics in video games**: The first real-time 3D polygonal rendering in video games emerged in 1992 with the release of games like Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Myst. These games were all built on the Doom Engine, which was developed by id Software. The engine used a rendering engine based on ray casting, which was modified to use polygonal rendering instead. The games were a huge commercial success, and as a result, the computer game industry saw a massive surge in the development of 3D computer graphics. This in turn, pushed the development of faster graphics hardware.
5. **The introduction of the Sony PlayStation in 1994**: The PlayStation was the first console to use a graphics processing unit (GPU) with polygonal rendering capabilities. The GPU was developed by NVIDIA, who had previously been a relatively unknown company. The success of the PlayStation and the GPU pushed the development of faster graphics hardware, and by 1996, the first graphics cards with texture mapping and polygonal rendering capabilities were introduced for the PC.
6. **The introduction of OpenGL and DirectX**: In 1992, Silicon Graphics (SGI) released the OpenGL specification, which became the industry standard for graphics extension development. Around the same time, Microsoft and NVIDIA released the DirectX specification, which became the industry standard for graphics card development. Both specifications pushed for the development of faster graphics hardware, and by 1996, the first graphics cards with texture mapping and polygonal rendering capabilities were introduced for the PC.

By the late 1990s, real-time 3D polygonal rendering had become the standard for both game consoles and PCs. The technology has continued to evolve,"
"Machine Translation (MT) is the process of translating text or speech from a source language to a target language by means of software rather than human translators. It is a sub-field of computational linguistics and natural language processing. The target language is usually a human language. The result is a rough translation of the original text or speech, which may or may not require editing by a human translator to achieve idiomatic fluency. Machine translation may be based on statistical methods such as the example-based machine translation or rule-based methods such as the syntax-based machine translation. The most common statistical MT approaches are based on the string -editing techniques of word alignment, and the use of large textual corpora.  A third approach, which combines the statistical and rule-based approaches, is less common but gaining importance.  The rule-based approach is also known as the ""syntactic machine translation"".  The syntax-based machine translation uses the syntactic structures of the source and target languages to translate the sentence from the source language into the target language.  The output of the machine translation system may be a written text or an audio recording.  Machine translation is the most common form of machine translation used today.  The other form is the example-based machine translation.  It uses the example sentences to translate the new sentences from the source language into the target language.  The example-based machine translation is also known as the ""example-based MT"".  The output of the machine translation system may be a written text or an audio recording.

"Machine translation has come a long way since its early experiments in the 1950s. Here are some key milestones in its development:

**1950s**: The first experiments in machine translation were conducted by Georgetown University and IBM. The short-term goal was to develop software that could translate Russian to English, while the long-term objective was to develop a complete translation system. The project was a success, producing the first fully automatic high-quality translations of Russian to English. However, the achievement was short-lived; the project was declassified in 1966, and the research was almost completely abandoned for over 30 years.

**1960s**: Research in machine translation continued at Georgetown and IBM, but funding was cut off in 1966. The University of Edinburgh in Scotland started research in machine translation in 1966, and continued until 1993. The research was primarily funded by the UK and Europe. The University of Alberta in Canada also started research in machine translation in 1966, and continued until 2004. The research was primarily funded by the Canadian government and the European Union.

**1970s**: The research in machine translation was almost completely abandoned in the US and Canada. The University of Edinburgh and the University of Alberta continued to receive funding from the UK and Europe. The French National Research Institute for Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) started research in machine translation in 1970. The German Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Daimi) started research in machine translation in 1972. The research in machine translation was primarily focused on developing systems for translating French, German, Italian, and Spanish to English.

**1980s**: The research in machine translation was revived in the US and Canada. The US government provided funding for machine translation research through the Strategic Computing Initiative and the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO). The IPTO was directed by Dr. Peter Jackson and was the main funding source for machine translation research in the US from 1985 to 1993. The research was primarily focused on developing systems for translating Russian and Arabic to English. The University of Montreal and LIT (Linguistic and Literary Technology) in Germany continued to receive funding from the Canadian government and the European Union. The research in machine translation was primarily focused on developing systems for translating French, German, Italian, and Spanish to English.

**1990s**: The Internet and the Web were invented. The Web provided a new distribution channel for machine translated content. The quality of machine translation was improved by the development of statistical machine translation. The first commercial machine translation systems were introduced. The quality of the systems was not good enough to be used by humans, but they were good enough to be used by computers. The systems were primarily used for translating patent applications and other technical documents. The quality of the systems was improved by the development of example-based machine translation. The first fully automatic high-quality translations of Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean to English were developed"
"The report is the ALPAC Report, also known as the Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee Report. It was published in 1966 by the US government. The report was commissioned by the US government in 1964 and was delivered to the US Congress in 1966. The report concluded that despite significant investment, machine translation was not yet a viable technology. The report stated that machine translation was not yet as good as human translation, and that human translation was too expensive. As a result, the US government stopped funding machine translation research. The report had a profound impact on research into machine translation in the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom. The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom continued to fund machine translation research, but at a much lower level than the US. As a result, the US became the leader in machine translation technology. The report also had an impact on the development of computational linguistics in general. The report was the subject of a famous article by Noam Chomsky, ""Three Cheers for Chomsky!"" Chomsky argued that the report was correct in its assessment that machine translation was not yet viable, but he argued that this was because machine translation was based on the wrong theoretical model of language. Chomsky argued that the correct model was his own generative grammar. Chomsky's article was widely read and caused a great deal of controversy. The article helped to popularize Chomskyan linguistics among the general public. Chomsky's ideas also had an impact on the philosophy of language and epistemology. Chomsky argued that the report showed that a child learns language by using an innate universal grammar, rather than by learning from its environment. Chomsky's ideas were widely debated and became the subject of a great deal of research. Chomsky's article was the subject of a symposium at the 1968 Summer Institute of Linguistics. The symposium was widely seen as a turning point in the development of generative grammar. The article was also the subject of a famous exchange between Chomsky and Noam's MIT colleague, Zellig Harris. Harris argued that machine translation was viable and that the failure was due to the lack of good computational algorithms. Harris argued that the correct approach was statistical, rather than symbolic. Harris's ideas were widely rejected and Harris left MIT shortly after the exchange. Harris's ideas were widely rediscovered in the 1990s. Harris's ideas were also foreshadowed by the work of Yehoshua Bar-Hillel. Bar-Hillel argued that machine translation was impossible, but that human translation was possible. Bar-Hillel argued that machine translation was impossible because of semantic ambiguity. Bar-Hillel argued that human translators could resolve semantic ambiguity, but that machine translators could not. Bar-Hillel's ideas were widely debated and became the subject of a great deal of research. Bar-Hillel's ideas were also foreshadowed by"

"Computers communicate with each other through a combination of physical cables and signals, and through wireless signals. The physical cables and wireless signals are converted to digital signals that convey information. The digital signals are then interpreted by the computers to understand the information being sent. The computers use this information to update their memory, send new information, or initiate actions. The process of communication between computers is similar to how humans communicate with each other. A sender sends a message to a receiver through a communication channel. The sender encodes the message into a signal that is sent through the channel. The receiver decodes the signal and interprets the message. The receiver can then respond back to the sender through the same channel. The process of sending and receiving is similar for both humans and computers. However, computers use electronic devices to send and receive information. The electronic devices include modems, routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, and network interface cards.

"Lasing is the process by which an optical amplifier or laser produces light. A laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification. The device uses stimulated emission to amplify light. The process starts with a light source passing through an optical gain medium. When a photon from the light source is absorbed by an atom or molecule in the gain medium, it raises that atom or molecule to a higher energy level. When an atom or molecule in the gain medium is in the higher energy state, it can emit a photon that is identical to the absorbed photon. This emitted photon can then be absorbed by another atom or molecule in the gain medium, which raises it to the higher energy state, and so on. This process continues until the gain medium is depleted of atoms or molecules in the lower energy state. The light emitted by the laser is coherent, which means that the phase and wavelength of the light are fixed. This is in contrast to incoherent light, such as sunlight, where the phase and wavelength are random. Lasers are widely used in many applications, including medicine, manufacturing, and telecommunications. The first working laser was introduced by Theodore Maiman in 1960. Maiman built on the work of Albert Einstein, who had first described stimulated emission in 1917. Einstein's work was based on a paper by Albert Schrank, who had built on the work of Ernest Ritter. The first theoretical description of a laser was made by Einstein's colleague, Hermann Loschmidt, in 1911. The first proposal for a device that could amplify light through stimulated emission was made by Einstein's Russian colleague, Gershikov, in 1929. The first proposal for a device that could amplify light through stimulated emission and produce a coherent beam of light was made by Einstein in 1917. The first working laser was introduced by Theodore Maiman in 1960. Maiman built on the work of Einstein, Schrank, Loschmidt, and Gershikov. Maiman's device was a ruby laser that produced red light. The device consisted of a rod of synthetic ruby that was optically pumped by a light source. The ruby was placed in a helium-neon mixture in a cylindrical resonant cavity. The cavity was formed by two parallel mirrors. When the ruby was pumped by the light source, it emitted a beam of coherent red light. The light was amplified by stimulated emission as it passed through the ruby. The light was then reflected back and forth between the two mirrors until it was reflected out of the cavity by one of the mirrors. The light emitted by the laser was coherent, which made it different from incoherent light, such as sunlight. The coherent light produced by the laser could be focused to a very small point, which made it useful for a variety of applications, including medicine, manufacturing, and telecommunications. The laser was"
"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was developed to remove the remaining centralized routing aspects from the Internet. BGP is an exterior gateway protocol that enables the exchange of routing information between autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. It forms the foundation of the Internet's interdomain routing. It was introduced in 1994. Before BGP, the Internet was organized into seven regions based on the continent they were in. Each region used the Border Gateway Protocol to exchange routing information. BGP was developed to remove the regional restrictions and allow the exchange of routing information between any two AS on the Internet. It was designed to be a more scalable and efficient routing protocol than earlier routing protocols. It is a path-vector protocol, which means that each AS advertises the paths it uses to reach a destination AS. This allows BGP to support many thousands of ASes. It is the primary routing protocol on the Internet. It is also used by most ISPs to exchange routing information with their customers. It is a component of the Internet's critical infrastructure. It is managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It is an open standard. It is not patented. It is used by almost all ISPs and most large enterprise networks.

"Text-to-Speech (TTS) is the process of converting written text into spoken audio. It is also known as ""speech synthesis"". The process typically converts written text to phonemic representation, then converts the phonemic representation to waveforms that can be output as sound.

On the other hand, the reverse process is Speech-to-Text (STT), which is the process of converting spoken audio into written text. This is also known as ""speech recognition"". The process typically involves sampling the audio, then using machine learning algorithms to identify the phonemes in the audio, and finally, using a dictionary to resolve the phonemes into words and sentences. STT is a more complex process than TTS, because there are many words in a language that sound very similar when spoken aloud. For example, ""father"" and ""ether"" are very easy to confuse, even for a human listener. Because of this, STT systems are often trained on very large corpora of text and audio. Additionally, STT systems are often multi-pass algorithms, meaning that they make multiple passes over the audio to resolve ambiguities. TTS, on the other hand, is typically a single-pass algorithm.  TTS is also simpler to implement than STT.  TTS can be implemented in a matter of weeks, while developing an accurate STT system can take years.  However, there are many commercial systems available that can perform both TTS and STT.  These systems are often used by people with visual impairments or other disabilities.  They can also be used by anyone who wants to have a computer read text aloud to them.  These systems are often web-based and can be accessed from any computer with an internet connection.  Examples of such systems include JAWS for Windows, Window-Eyes, Supernova, System Access, Non-visual Desktop Access, and the text-to-speech functionality in the Windows Narrator.  There are also many web-based text-to-speech systems available, including the IBM Simultaneous Translation System, the Amazon Alexa system, and the Google Text-to-Speech system.

"The impact of the Internet's wider availability on video games was profound and far-reaching. Here are some key effects:

1. **Online gaming**: The Internet enabled video games to transition from single-player experiences to online games that allowed players to interact with each other. This opened up new gameplay possibilities and created new genres such as MMOs (Massively Multiplayer Online games). Examples include Ultima Online (1997), EverQuest (1999), and World of Warcraft (2004). Online games also introduced new business models such as subscription-based games and free-to-play games supported by microtransactions. Online gaming also introduced the concept of digital rights management and game piracy prevention. Examples include Steam, Battle.net, and Origin.

"The first commercial multi-chip microprocessors were the Four-Phase Systems 4MP and the Garrett AiResearch MP944, both released in 1971. The 4MP was a 15-bit processor with four chips: a control logic chip, a arithmetic logic unit (ALU) chip, a memory control chip, and an I/O control chip. The MP944 was an 18-bit processor with three chips: a control chip, an ALU chip, and a memory chip.

The first commercial single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, released in 1971. It was developed by a team led by Ted Hoff at Intel. It was a complete CPU with all the necessary components (including the ALU, registers, and microsequencer) on one MOS integrated circuit (IC) chip. It was used in the Intel 8008, the first commercial microprocessor-based computer, which was released in 1972. The Intel 8008 was based on the Intel 4004, but with an added set of registers and control logic. It was a 16-bit processor with an instruction set based on the binary-coded decimal (BCD) system. The Intel 8008 was used in the Intel 8080, which was released in 1974. The 8080 was an 8-bit processor with an instruction set based on the two's complement system. It was used in the Altair 8800, which was released in 1975 and was the first commercially successful computer kit. The Altair was based on the Intel 8080, but with an added set of I/O control logic. It was also the first computer to use a keyboard and monitor. The Altair was a major step forward in the development of the personal computer. It was the first computer that was both relatively inexpensive and capable of being programmed by an individual. It was also the first computer to be used by hobbyists to develop new hardware and software. The Altair was the direct ancestor of the IBM PC and all of its clones."

"Websites for the general public began to emerge in 1993-1994. The effect was the democratization of the Internet. Up until this time, the Internet was primarily used by scientists and researchers. The introduction of websites for the general public was the turning point that made the Internet accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. This was made possible by the introduction of the Mosaic web browser in 1993 and the Netscape Navigator in 1994. These browsers were the first to include graphics and were easy to use, making the Internet accessible to non-technical people. This was the start of the Web 1.0, which was characterized by static pages and limited interactivity. It was the start of the commercialization of the Internet, as companies began to see the potential of the Web and started to invest in it. This was also the start of e-commerce on the Web. The effect was that the Web started to become a mass medium, and the number of users grew exponentially. By 1996, the number of users was 10 million, and by 1998, it was 50 million. This was the start of the Web as we know it today. The democratization of the Internet had a profound effect on society. It made information that was previously unavailable to the general public available to anyone with an Internet connection. It also created new opportunities for people to participate in the global economy. It made it possible for companies to sell goods and services to anyone in the world. It also created new forms of media, such as blogs, social networking sites, and user-generated content. It made it possible for anyone to publish their work on the Web.

"Antics is a 2D computer animation software developed by Avid Technology. It was initially released in 1992. Antics was designed for creating broadcast-standard animation, primarily for television. The software was used to produce numerous TV series, such as Rugrats, Rockne S. O'Bannon's The New Yonder, and The Brothers Grunt. Antics was discontinued in 2002. Avid sold the software to a third-party company, which continued to develop and support it. However, the software was eventually phased out, and its current status is unknown. Notable features included a ""rubber band"" warping tool, a ""painterly"" fill tool, and a ""morph"" effect. Antics was also known for its ""antialiased"" vector rendering, which was considered one of the best at the time. Antics was used by many animation studios, and was often cited as one of the best animation software packages ever made. It was succeeded by Avid's other 2D software, Celatron."
"The two main components of C++ are:

1. **A high-level programming language**: C++ provides a high-level programming language that allows users to write programs that can be compiled and executed on various computer hardware platforms. It provides classes, which are combined to form objects that can be manipulated using various operators and built-in functions.

2. **A software library**: C++ provides a standard library that contains various functions and classes to support the language and its standard features. It also contains the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides generic containers and algorithms for use with the classes and functions provided by the library and user-defined classes."
"The Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. Wayne, who worked as an engineer at Atari, Inc. and had been involved in early negotiations with Jobs and Wozniak to start a business together, eventually became disillusioned with the idea of starting a computer business and sold his share of the company for $800. The two Steves then started the company with an initial investment of $1,000."

"The 1970s was a pivotal decade for the democratization of computer game development. Several programming languages that were widely used during this decade helped pave the way for non-professional programmers to create their own games. Here are some of the most notable ones:

1. BASIC: The programming language BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was developed in the 1960s. A simple and easy-to-learn language, BASIC was widely used on home computers of the 1970s, such as the Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80. BASIC games were often created by their owners, and many of these games were simple but still fun, such as Adventure (on the Atari 8-bit computers) and Star Wars (on the Atari 8-bit computers and Commodore 64 ). BASIC games were also created for the Sinclair ZX80, ZX81, and ZX Spectrum.
2. BASIC with Visual Basic (on the Apple II): Apple introduced the BASIC programming language on its Apple II computer in 1977. The following year, Apple released a version of BASIC with a visual interface, which allowed users to create games without needing to learn the BASIC programming language. This was the first ""visual basic"" programming environment, and the precursor to the modern Visual Basic programming language. Games like VisiCalc, which was originally a BASIC game, and a number of other games were created using this system.
3. BASIC on the Commodore 64: The Commodore 64 was released in 1982, and included a BASIC interpreter. The machine was extremely popular, and thousands of games were created for it using BASIC. Games like Elite, which was originally a BASIC game, and many others were created using this system.
4. BASIC on the Atari 8-bit computers: The Atari 8-bit computers were released in 1979, and included a BASIC interpreter. The machines were extremely popular, and thousands of games were created for them using BASIC. Games like Monty on the Run, which was originally a BASIC game, and many others were created using this system.
5. Pascal on the Atari 8-bit computers: The Atari 8-bit computers were also able to be programmed in the Pascal programming language. Games like Boulder Dash, which was originally a Pascal game, and many others were created using this system.
6. C on the Atari 8-bit computers: The Atari 8-bit computers were also able to be programmed in the C programming language. Games like Elite, which was originally a C game, and many others were created using this system.
7. BASIC on the ZX Spectrum: The ZX Spectrum was released in 1982, and included a BASIC interpreter. The machine was extremely popular, and thousands of games were created for it using BASIC. Games like Elite, which was originally a BASIC game, and many others were created using this system.

These programming languages were widely used by hobbyist programmers to create games"
"Databases and DBMSs can be categorized in the following four ways:

1. **By the data model**: This refers to the underlying mathematical structure used to organize the data. Examples include the relational model, the entity–relationship model, and the XML model.
2. **By the database architecture**: This refers to the organization of the data storage and the assumptions made about the storage (such as the concept of a ""record""). Examples include the hierarchical model, the CODASYL model, and the relational model.
3. **By the query language**: This refers to the language used to access the database. Examples include SQL, XQuery, and XPath.
4. **By some combination of the above**: For example, a DBMS that uses a relational architecture and a relational query language but implements the entity–relationship model in its internal data structures. (This is often referred to as a hybrid database.)"

"The technological development that made it practical to create a digital memory system with framebuffers capable of holding a standard-definition video image was the development of the MOS (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) large-scale integration (LSI) microprocessor. Specifically, the Intel 4004, released in 1971, was the first commercial single-chip microprocessor. It was the first self-contained microprocessor containing all the components necessary to run a computer on a single MOS LSI chip. This chip was the first step towards the development of faster and cheaper microprocessors, which eventually led to the development of framebuffers capable of holding a standard-definition video image. The framebuffer was first developed in the early 1970s at the University of Manchester by Roger Needham and his team. The framebuffer was a digital memory system that could store a complete standard-definition (SD) video image. It was the first digital memory system capable of holding a complete video image. The framebuffer was the precursor to all subsequent display technology, including the cathode ray tube (CRT) and liquid-crystal display (LCD) screens. It was also the precursor to all subsequent computer graphics hardware. The framebuffer was first used in the 1973 to 1978 period in the development of the first computer graphics systems at the University of Manchester, the University of Cambridge, and the University of Illinois. The first commercial framebuffer was released in 1974 by Evans & Sutherland. It was a 512x512-pixel framebuffer with a memory capacity of 256 kilobytes.

"Computer vision and digital image processing (DIP) are related fields that both deal with the processing of visual information from images and video. While DIP focuses on the processing of digital images, computer vision focuses on the automatic extraction, analysis, and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding. As a result, computer vision is concerned with the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of computer vision, while DIP is concerned with the practical aspects. Computer vision is a sub-field of engineering and computer science, while DIP is a sub-field of physics and electrical engineering. Computer vision is a more general field than DIP, since DIP is a subset of computer vision. Computer vision includes DIP as a sub-field, but also includes other sub-fields such as motion estimation, object detection, event detection, activity recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, and tracking. Computer vision provides a theoretical and algorithmic basis for many of the techniques used in DIP. Many of the techniques developed in computer vision can be directly applied to DIP, and vice versa. However, computer vision is more general and includes DIP as a sub-field."
"France set up a two-node domestic TCP/IP network in 1982. The nodes were the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) and the Université de Paris (Ultria). INRIA was connected to CSNET, and Ultria to NSFNET. This was the first domestic TCP/IP network in Europe. It was also the first international TCP/IP network. INRA and Ultria were connected via a 2400 baud modem. The connection was made possible by the work of Louis Pouzin, who had been a pioneer of packet switching in France in the 1970s, and by the support of the French National Research Network (RNRT). The RNRT was a project of the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) aimed at creating a nationwide high-speed network for scientific and academic purposes. The first international TCP/IP connection was made in 1983 between INRA and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The connection was made possible by the work of Louis Pouzin and by the support of the RNRT and CSNET. It was the first international TCP/IP connection outside of Europe. It was made possible by the work of Steve Crocker, who was the director of CSNET at the time, and by the support of the RNRT and INRA. The connection was made using a 48 kbit/s satellite link.

"One of the first graphical web browsers was Mosaic, developed by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Mosaic was released on 8 June 1993. It ran on Unix, Apple Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows platforms. Mosaic was the first web browser aimed at non-technical users, and introduced features that are still in use today, such as the ability to display images inline with text, hyperlinked text and images, and support for forms and JavaScript. It was the first web browser to support embedded graphics, and it was the first web browser to use a graphical user interface (GUI). It was also the first web browser to support cookies, which allowed web sites to remember users' preferences and logins. Mosaic was a major success, and is credited with sparking the Internet boom of the 1990s. It was the first web browser to be used by millions of people around the world. It was succeeded by NCSA's Mosaic Communications Corporation, which was acquired by AOL in 1998. The Mosaic browser was succeeded by Netscape Navigator, which was also developed by NCSA."

The most common reason for transforming source code is to create an executable program. A compiler may also produce intermediate code or partially compiled code as its output. The most important role of a compiler is to translate a program written by software developers into machine code that the computer can execute. It is the first stage in the build process and is typically the first step in the development of any software. It is often the responsibility of the compiler to check for errors in the source code and report them to the programmer. It is also the compiler's responsibility to inform the linker (the next stage in the build process) of any dependencies that the program has on other programs or libraries. Compilers are a crucial part of the software development process and are used by most programmers. They are also used by embedded developers to generate machine code for microprocessors. Compilers may also be used to translate executable programs from one computer architecture to another. For example, a program written for the Intel x86 architecture can be compiled to run on the ARM architecture. This is called cross compiling. The importance of a compiler is that it allows software to be written in a high-level language and executed on a computer. It also allows software to be written in a platform independent language and executed on many different computer platforms. It also allows software to be written in a language that is easier to read and write than machine code. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily reused. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily debugged. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily maintained. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily modified. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily shared. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily sold. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily leased. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily translated. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily understood. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily modified. It also allows software to be written in a language that can be easily reused.

"When Netscape was unable to commercially fund the development of its product, Mozilla, it released the source code of its web browser under an open-source license. This allowed the community to continue developing the browser, which became Mozilla Firefox. As a result, Netscape's declining market share was slowed. Netscape was a pioneer in the web browser space and introduced the concept of open-source development to the commercial software world. This had long-term benefits as it allowed the community to continue developing the product after commercial funding was no longer available. It also helped to increase the adoption of open-source software in general."
"When attempting to build a fully functional web browser from the Netscape Communicator code base, Mozilla developers faced numerous challenges. These included:

1.  Code size:  The Netscape code base was enormous, with more than 1.8 million lines of code. This made it difficult to maintain and also made it a target for hackers. To address this, the developers focused on modularizing the code. They separated the code into smaller, independent components, which made it easier to maintain and also reduced the size of the code base. This was done using the Gecko layout engine, which separates the different components of a web page (such as the HTML, CSS, and graphics) into different objects. This allows the browser to render a web page more efficiently. It also allows the developers to fix bugs or add new features without having to rewrite the entire browser.

2.  Code quality:  The Netscape code base was of poor quality. It was written by many different programmers over a long period of time, and there was no consistent coding standard. This made it difficult to maintain and also made it a target for hackers. To address this, the developers focused on improving the code quality. They did this by writing automated tests to ensure that the code worked as expected, and by using code analysis tools to identify areas of the code that needed improvement. They also developed a coding standard that all developers were expected to follow. This made it easier for the developers to maintain the code and also reduced the number of bugs in the code.

3.  Performance:  The Netscape code base was not very efficient. It used a lot of CPU and memory, which made it difficult to use on slower machines. To address this, the developers focused on improving the efficiency of the code. They did this by using automated tools to identify areas of the code that were using a lot of CPU or memory, and by rewriting the code to make it more efficient. They also developed a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which compiled JavaScript code into machine code while the browser was running. This made it possible for the browser to run JavaScript code more efficiently.

4.  Security:  The Netscape code base had many security problems. It was a target for hackers, who were always looking for ways to exploit it. To address this, the developers focused on improving the security of the code. They did this by writing automated tests to ensure that the code worked as expected, and by using code analysis tools to identify areas of the code that needed improvement. They also developed a secure coding standard that all developers were expected to follow. This made it easier for the developers to maintain the code and also reduced the number of security problems in the code.

5.  User interface:  The Netscape code base had a user interface that was not very good. It was difficult to use and understand. To address this, the developers focused on improving the user interface. They did this by writing automated tests"
The first iPhone was released in 2007.
"The technological advancement that led to the disappearance of the floppy disk as a standard feature of microcomputers was the rise of the solid-state hard drive. The first hard drive was introduced in the 1950s, but it was expensive and large compared to other storage devices. By the 1980s, the cost had dropped and the technology had improved to the point where it was cheaper and more practical than floppy disks. The first microcomputer with a hard drive was the 1983 Apple Lisa, and by the 1990s, floppy disks were no longer a standard feature on any microcomputer. The rise of USB flash drives in the early 2000s eventually led to the obsolescence of the floppy disk for most practical purposes."
"The animal is a penguin, and its name is Tux. Tux is a superfluous (unneeded) T (torvalds) + UX (user experience) pun. It was chosen by Torvalds as the mascot for Linux, and it is used in the Linux distribution's logo and other materials. Tux is a penguin, specifically the Adelie penguin, native to Antarctica. The name was suggested by James Hughes as a pun on the TUX kernel (torvalds+user experience) and was accepted by Torvalds. Tux is also the name of the mascot for the Gentoo Linux distribution."
"The oN-Line System (NLS) was developed by Douglas Engelbart's Augmentation for Human Intellect project at the Augmentation Research Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The project was funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The first public demonstration of NLS was in December 1968 at the Association for Computing Machinery / Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (ACM/IEEE)—Computer Society's Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco. It was a live demonstration of the system's features, including hypertext, graphics, split-screen windows, mouse, and video conferencing. The demo was given by Douglas Engelbart and his team, including Larry Roberts, Bill English, and a young Alan Kay. It was so-called The Mother of All Demos. In 1973, the team moved to Xerox PARC. Alan Kay developed the Smalltalk programming language at PARC. The ideas developed at PARC and Engelbart's NLS had a profound impact on the development of personal computers, especially the graphical user interface (GUI) and windowed operating systems."
"Google Docs was launched in 2006. It originated from Writely, a web-based word processor developed by the software company Upstartle, which was founded by Steve Newman and Steve Palladino. Google acquired Upstartle in 2006, and rebranded Writely as Google Docs & Spreadsheets. At the time of the acquisition, Writely had around 100,000 users. Google Docs & Spreadsheets was later integrated with Gmail to form the suite of products that is now known as Google Drive."
