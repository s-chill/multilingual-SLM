Such environments may provide visual feedback of the state of versioned items and add repository commands to the menus of the development environment. Examples of this approach include AnkhSVN , and VisualSVN for use with Microsoft Visual Studio , and Eclipse Subversive for use with Eclipse Platform IDEs . Delphi XE Subversion integration is built into the Delphi integrated development environment .
