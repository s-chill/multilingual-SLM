Armstrong's axioms are a set of axioms (or, more precisely, inference rules ) used to infer all the functional dependencies on a relational database . They were developed by William W. Armstrong in his 1974 paper. The axioms are sound in generating only functional dependencies in the closure of a set of functional dependencies (denoted as F + {\displaystyle F^{+}} ) when applied to that set (denoted as F {\displaystyle F} ). They are also complete in that repeated application of these rules will generate all functional dependencies in the closure F + {\displaystyle F^{+}} .

More formally, let ⟨ R ( U ) , F ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle R(U),F\rangle } denote a relational scheme over the set of attributes U {\displaystyle U} with a set of functional dependencies F {\displaystyle F} . We say that a functional dependency f {\displaystyle f} is logically implied by F {\displaystyle F} , and denote it with F ⊨ f {\displaystyle F\models f} if and only if for every instance r {\displaystyle r} of R {\displaystyle R} that satisfies the functional dependencies in F {\displaystyle F} , r {\displaystyle r} also satisfies f {\displaystyle f} . We denote by F + {\displaystyle F^{+}} the set of all functional dependencies that are logically implied by F {\displaystyle F} .

Furthermore, with respect to a set of inference rules A {\displaystyle A} , we say that a functional dependency f {\displaystyle f} is derivable from the functional dependencies in F {\displaystyle F} by the set of inference rules A {\displaystyle A} , and we denote it by F ⊢ A f {\displaystyle F\vdash _{A}f} if and only if f {\displaystyle f} is obtainable by means of repeatedly applying the inference rules in A {\displaystyle A} to functional dependencies in F {\displaystyle F} . We denote by F A ∗ {\displaystyle F_{A}^{*}} the set of all functional dependencies that are derivable from F {\displaystyle F} by inference rules in A {\displaystyle A} .

Then, a set of inference rules A {\displaystyle A} is sound if and only if the following holds:

F A ∗ ⊆ F + {\displaystyle F_{A}^{*}\subseteq F^{+}}

that is to say, we cannot derive by means of A {\displaystyle A} functional dependencies that are not logically implied by F {\displaystyle F} .
The set of inference rules A {\displaystyle A} is said to be complete if the following holds:

F + ⊆ F A ∗ {\displaystyle F^{+}\subseteq F_{A}^{*}}

more simply put, we are able to derive by A {\displaystyle A} all the functional dependencies that are logically implied by F {\displaystyle F} .

Let R ( U ) {\displaystyle R(U)} be a relation scheme over the set of attributes U {\displaystyle U} . Henceforth we will denote by letters X {\displaystyle X} , Y {\displaystyle Y} , Z {\displaystyle Z} any subset of U {\displaystyle U} and, for short, the union of two sets of attributes X {\displaystyle X} and Y {\displaystyle Y} by X Y {\displaystyle XY} instead of the usual X ∪ Y {\displaystyle X\cup Y} ; this notation is rather standard in database theory when dealing with sets of attributes.

If X {\displaystyle X} is a set of attributes and Y {\displaystyle Y} is a subset of X {\displaystyle X} , then X {\displaystyle X} holds Y {\displaystyle Y} . Hereby, X {\displaystyle X} holds Y {\displaystyle Y} [ X → Y {\displaystyle X\to Y} ] means that X {\displaystyle X} functionally determines Y {\displaystyle Y} .

If X {\displaystyle X} holds Y {\displaystyle Y} and Z {\displaystyle Z} is a set of attributes, then X Z {\displaystyle XZ} holds Y Z {\displaystyle YZ} . It means that attribute in dependencies does not change the basic dependencies.

If X {\displaystyle X} holds Y {\displaystyle Y} and Y {\displaystyle Y} holds Z {\displaystyle Z} , then X {\displaystyle X} holds Z {\displaystyle Z} .

These rules can be derived from the above axioms.

If X → Y Z {\displaystyle X\to YZ} then X → Y {\displaystyle X\to Y} and X → Z {\displaystyle X\to Z} .

If X → Y {\displaystyle X\to Y} and A → B {\displaystyle A\to B} then X A → Y B {\displaystyle XA\to YB} .

If X → Y {\displaystyle X\to Y} and X → Z {\displaystyle X\to Z} then X → Y Z {\displaystyle X\to YZ} .

If X → Y {\displaystyle X\to Y} and Y Z → W {\displaystyle YZ\to W} then X Z → W {\displaystyle XZ\to W} .

I → I {\displaystyle I\to I} for any I {\displaystyle I} . This follows directly from the axiom of reflexivity.

The following property is a special case of augmentation when Z = X {\displaystyle Z=X} .

Extensivity can replace augmentation as axiom in the sense that augmentation can be proved from extensivity together with the other axioms.

Given a set of functional dependencies F {\displaystyle F} , an Armstrong relation is a relation which satisfies all the functional dependencies in the closure F + {\displaystyle F^{+}} and only those dependencies. Unfortunately, the minimum-size Armstrong relation for a given set of dependencies can have a size which is an exponential function of the number of attributes in the dependencies considered.
