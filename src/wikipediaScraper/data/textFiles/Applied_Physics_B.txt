Topical coverage includes laser physics, optical & laser materials, linear optics, nonlinear optics, quantum optics, and photonic devices. Interest also includes laser spectroscopy pertaining to atoms, molecules, and clusters. The journal publishes original research articles, invited reviews, and rapid communications.

The journal Applied Physics was originally conceived and founded in 1972 by Helmut K.V. Lotsch at Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York. Lotsch edited the journal up to volume 25 and split it thereafter into the two part A 26(Solids and Surfaces) and B 26(Photophysics and Laser Chemistry). He continued his editorship up to the volumes A 61 and B 61. Starting in 1995 the two journal parts were continued under separate editorships: Applied Physics B : Photophysics and Laser Chemistry ( ISSN 0721-7269 ), in existence from September 1981 (volume B : 26 no. 1) to December 1993 (volume B : 57 no. 6) It partly continues Applied Physics ( ISSN 0340-3793 ), in existence from January 1973 (volume 1 no. 1) to August 1981 (volume 25 no. 4).
