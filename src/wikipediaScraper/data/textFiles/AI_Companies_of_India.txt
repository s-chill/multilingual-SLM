Artificial intelligence companies in india refers to the development, adoption, and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the country. The AI market in India is projected to reach $8 billion by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40% from 2020 to 2025.

India's journey in AI began in the 1960s through the works of professor H.N. Mahabala, and has since developed into a robust ecosystem supported by government initiatives, academic research, and private sector innovation.

The Indian government has implemented several measures to promote AI development and adoption. In 2018, NITI Aayog launched the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, aiming to leverage AI for inclusive growth and address societal needs in areas such as healthcare, education, agriculture, and smart cities. Major technology companies, startups, and research institutions are contributing to India's AI ecosystem, with key AI clusters emerging in cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai.

While AI presents significant opportunities for economic growth and social development in India, challenges such as data privacy concerns, skill shortages, and ethical considerations need to be addressed for responsible AI deployment.

India currently does not have specific laws regulating artificial intelligence (AI). However, the Indian government has introduced several initiatives and guidelines aimed at the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.

The Indian government has tasked NITI Aayog , its apex public policy think tank, with establishing guidelines and policies for AI. In 2018, NITI Aayog released the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, also known as #AIForAll, which focuses on healthcare, agriculture, education, smart cities, and smart mobility.

In 2021, NITI Aayog published the "Principles for Responsible AI," addressing ethical considerations for AI deployment in India. These principles cover system considerations, such as decision-making and accountability, and societal considerations, such as the impact of automation on employment. The second part of this document, "Operationalizing Principles for Responsible AI," released in August 2021, focuses on implementing these ethical principles through regulatory and policy interventions, capacity building, and incentivizing ethical practices.

In 2023, the Indian government enacted the Digital Personal Data Protection Act , which addresses some privacy concerns related to AI platforms. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has also issued advisories requiring platforms to obtain explicit permission before deploying unreliable AI models and to label AI-generated content to prevent misuse.

India is a member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) , which promotes the responsible use of AI through international collaboration. In 2023, the GPAI Summit was held in New Delhi, where experts discussed responsible AI, data governance, and the future of work.

Other Indian agencies, such as the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) , are also working on AI policies. BIS has established a committee to propose draft standards for AI, focusing on safety, reliability, and ethical considerations.

India has not yet enacted specific AI regulations. However, the government has introduced measures to promote innovation and address ethical concerns and risks associated with AI. These efforts aim to support the growth of India's AI ecosystem and ensure responsible AI deployment.
