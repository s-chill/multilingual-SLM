A 2+2 (also 2-plus-2 ) is a car-body style that has a seat each for the driver and front passenger, and two rear seats.  The latter may be individual "bucket" seats, fold-downs, or a full-width "bucketed" bench seat, but always with less leg room than either the front or a standard 2-door car. The style is different from 4- or 5- seat automobiles having normal-size rear seats, with second-row 2+2 seating typically only suitable for children or occasional use.

By standard definition, all cars in the 2+2 category have two front seats and two rear seats. Other common characteristics for 2+2 cars include relatively little room for the rear passengers and a "streamlined" body with two doors.  While 2+2 seating is most commonly associated with coupés , especially those which strongly favour front passenger seating such as sports cars and gran turismos , certain convertibles with "auxiliary"-type rear seats may also be regarded as 2+2s.

Some vehicles (such as the TVR Cerbera and Toyota iQ ) have been marketed as "3+1" due to their front passenger seat having more space for forward adjustment than the driver's, allowing for more leg room for one rear-seat passenger.

There are many coupés which meet the definition of a 2+2 but are not described by their manufacturers as such. This is because the term 2+2 is most often used to distinguish cars with what typically amounts to "auxiliary" rear seating, at times enlarged from a 2-seat version of the same model to accommodate it, such as the Jaguar E-type fixed-head coupé 2+2.  Other similar examples of stretched 2-seaters include the Lotus Elan +2, Mazda RX-8 , and Nissan 280ZX 2+2.
