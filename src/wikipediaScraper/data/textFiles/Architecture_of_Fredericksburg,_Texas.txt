The architectural structures of Fredericksburg , Texas, are often unique to the Texas Hill Country , and are historical edifices of the German immigrants who settled the area in the 19th century. Many of the structures have historic designations on a state or national level.  The Gillespie County Historical Society is actively involved in assisting with preservation.

On October 14, 1970, the Fredericksburg Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in Texas .

The Sunday Houses are unique to the German immigrant culture of the Texas Hill Country. In reverse of the old European tradition of living in town while working the rural farms, the early Fredericksburg German settlers made their main homes on the acreage they worked.  On their town lots, they erected Sunday Houses for overnight stays on their weekly travels into town for supplies and church attendance.  Older generations would use the houses as a retirement house, as the younger generations inherited the acreage and the work. These houses were often made of limestone rock coated with whitewash inside and out.  Depending on the individual family's need, these relatively small houses were designed for limited stays, with one or two ground floor rooms and an upper loft for sleeping.  Standard design was a fireplace and a porch. Often there was an outside staircase leading to the loft. Many of these homes in Fredericksburg have been restored, with some of them being used as bed-and-breakfast retreats.

The Pioneer Museum Complex is located at 325 W Main Street. The 3.5 acre complex includes a museum and historical buildings.

Marktplatz

The Vereins Kirche, or Peoples Church, was designed by Friedrich Schubbert (aka Friedrich Armand Strubberg ) and became the first public building in Fredericksburg in 1847. It served as a nondenominational church, school, town hall, and fort. Locals refer to it as the Kaffeemühle (The Coffee Mill) Church for its shape. Pupils learned their lessons in their own German language , and their parents paid $1 per quarter in tuition for each child. The first teacher in the Vereins-Kirche in 1847 was Professor Johann (John) Leyendecker, who emigrated from Rhineland-Palatinate with his wife and five children. They sailed on the ship Riga , which left Antwerp on November 7, 1845, and arrived in Galveston on February 1, 1846. Leyendecker also provided his home for Catholic services.  Leyendecker was succeeded as the Vereins Kirche teacher in 1848 by Jacob Brodbeck. The building models a style known as Carolingian architecture , similar to the Aachen Cathedral . Each side of the octagon was 18 feet (5.5 m) wide by 18 feet (5.5 m) high, with each side having a roof 10 feet (3.0 m) high, topped by a 7-foot (2.1 m) high octagonal cupola.  A rooster weather vane that sat on top was destroyed by lightning and replaced by a cross. In 1896 (or 1897) the original building was torn down. The Vereins Kirche was rebuilt in 1936, using the cornerstone from the original building.

The Arhelger Bathhouse operated from 1910 to 1930 for travelers; it was donated by Kenneth and JoAnn Kothe in 1995.

The Turnvereins, or athletic clubs, were begun in Germany by Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in 1811, and were brought to the United States by the Forty-Eighters political refugees. In Texas, it became two words, Turn Verein, and served as social, political and athletic centers.  The German founders of the clubs in Texas were usually civic leaders, teachers, scientists and artists.  Turners helped popularize bowling in the United States, advocated physical education and fitness, and lobbied local school boards for the inclusion of physical education classes in the curriculum. The Fredericksburg Social Turn Verein was established in 1871, with a gymnastics school and a 9-pin bowling alley. In 1872 the club began annual Christmas celebrations.  The Turners instituted the City Volunteer Fire Department in 1883. The Fredericksburg Social Turn Verein moved to 103 W. Travis Street in 1909, and remains active as one of the city's oldest continuing organizations.
