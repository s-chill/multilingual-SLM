The U.S. National Academy of Engineering annually awards the Draper Prize , which is given for the advancement of engineering and the education of the public about engineering. It is one of three prizes that constitute the "Nobel Prizes of Engineering"â€”the others are the Academy's Russ and Gordon Prizes . The Draper Prize is awarded biennially and the winner of each of these prizes receives $500,000. The Draper prize is named for Charles Stark Draper , the "father of inertial navigation ", an MIT professor and founder of Draper Laboratory .

The NAE website shows that no Draper Prize was awarded in 2010, 2017, 2019 or 2021. Since the award is a biennial one, it was probably only given in even years beginning in 2016. The Russ Prize , also from the NAE, is awarded in odd years.
