Counting in prehistory was first assisted by using body parts, primarily the fingers . This is reflected in the etymology of certain number names , such as in the names of ten and hundred in the Proto-Indo-European numerals , both containing the root * dá¸± also seen in the word for "finger" (Latin digitus , cognate to English toe ).

Early systems of counting using tally marks appear in the Upper Paleolithic .
The first more complex systems develop in the Ancient Near East together with the development of early writing out of proto-writing systems.

Numerals originally developed from the use of tally marks as a counting aid, with the oldest examples being about 35,000 to 25,000 years old.

Counting aids like tally marks become more sophisticated in the Near Eastern Neolithic , developing into numerical digits in various types of proto-writing during the Chalcolithic .
