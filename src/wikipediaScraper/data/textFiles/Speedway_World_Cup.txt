The Speedway World Cup is a motorcycle speedway event for national teams held in different countries. The first edition of the competition in the current format was held in 2001 and replaced the old World Team Cup which ran from 1960 until 2000. The competition was held annually until 2017 when it was replaced by the Speedway of Nations pairs event. The Speedway World Cup returned in 2023 and will be held every three years.

The current tournament format consists of two semi finals with the winner qualifying for the grand final and the second and third place teams entering a race off. In the four team race off only the winner will join the two semi final winners and the hosts in the grand final.
