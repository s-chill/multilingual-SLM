Hirudiculture is the culture, or farming , of leeches in both natural and artificial environments.  This practice drew the attention of Parisian savants and members of the French Société Zoologique d'Acclimitation in the mid-to-late 19th century as a part of a larger interest in the culture of fish and oysters . Leech culture was seen as a solution to growing demand for medicinal leeches throughout the world.

The use of leeches for medicinal purposes, or hirudotherapy , has been revived by contemporary medicine.
