The potential magnetic energy of a magnet or magnetic moment m {\displaystyle \mathbf {m} } in a magnetic field B {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} } is defined as the mechanical work of the magnetic force on the re-alignment of the vector of the magnetic dipole moment and is equal to: E p,m = − m ⋅ B {\displaystyle E_{\text{p,m}}=-\mathbf {m} \cdot \mathbf {B} } The mechanical work takes the form of a torque N {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {N}}} : N = m × B = − r × ∇ E p,m {\displaystyle \mathbf {N} =\mathbf {m} \times \mathbf {B} =-\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {\nabla } E_{\text{p,m}}} which will act to "realign" the magnetic dipole with the magnetic field.

In an electronic circuit the energy stored in an inductor (of inductance L {\displaystyle L} ) when a current I {\displaystyle I} flows through it is given by: E p,m = 1 2 L I 2 . {\displaystyle E_{\text{p,m}}={\frac {1}{2}}LI^{2}.} This expression forms the basis for superconducting magnetic energy storage. It can be derived from a time average of the product of current and voltage across an inductor.

Energy is also stored in a magnetic field itself. The energy per unit volume u {\displaystyle u} in a region of free space with vacuum permeability μ 0 {\displaystyle \mu _{0}} containing magnetic field B {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} } is: u = 1 2 B 2 μ 0 {\displaystyle u={\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {B^{2}}{\mu _{0}}}} More generally, if we assume that the medium is paramagnetic or diamagnetic so that a linear constitutive equation exists that relates B {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} } and the magnetization H {\displaystyle \mathbf {H} } (for example H = B / μ {\displaystyle \mathbf {H} =\mathbf {B} /\mu } where μ {\displaystyle \mu } is the magnetic permeability of the material), then it can be shown that the magnetic field stores an energy of E = 1 2 ∫ H ⋅ B d V {\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}\int \mathbf {H} \cdot \mathbf {B} \,\mathrm {d} V} where the integral is evaluated over the entire region where the magnetic field exists.

For a magnetostatic system of currents in free space, the stored energy can be found by imagining the process of linearly turning on the currents and their generated magnetic field, arriving at a total energy of: E = 1 2 ∫ J ⋅ A d V {\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}\int \mathbf {J} \cdot \mathbf {A} \,\mathrm {d} V} where J {\displaystyle \mathbf {J} } is the current density field and A {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} } is the magnetic vector potential . This is analogous to the electrostatic energy expression 1 2 ∫ ρ ϕ d V {\textstyle {\frac {1}{2}}\int \rho \phi \,\mathrm {d} V} ; note that neither of these static expressions apply in the case of time-varying charge or current distributions.
