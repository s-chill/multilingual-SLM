Freeskates consist of two separate metal or wooden plates with two wheels attached at an angle. People call it freeskating, freeline skating, or drift skating.

They were developed in 2003 in San Francisco by Ryan Farrelly. Farrelly founded a company called Freeline that has since gone out of business. Freeskating is practiced around the world. In 2015, former members of the original brand (Freeline) came together to create JMKRIDE. Based in San Diego, California JMKRIDE aimed to revive the sport they loved so much. The sport was rebranded to be called "freeskating" to reach worldwide riders.

You ride Freeskates sideways and move your feet back-and-forth in a motion called pumping to accelerate.
