ATL Server is a technology originally developed by Microsoft for developing web-based applications . It uses a tag replacement engine written in C++ to render web pages . It draws on the existing technologies like ISAPI and the Active Template Library , and includes a template library which is dedicated for use with developing Web-based applications.

ATL Server first appeared with Visual Studio .NET 2003 . It was included in Visual Studio 2005 but is no longer supported since the release of Visual Studio 2008 . Most of the ATL Server code base has been released as a shared source project on CodePlex , a Microsoft-run code sharing web site.

A typical ATL server application consists of at least one ISAPI extension DLL along with one or a number of Server Response Files (.srf) and their associated application DLL files which provide the application functionality.

SRF files can contain a mix of HTML and script tags.  SRF script tags are denoted by the {{ opening and }} closing braces.

A single SRF file may call code from a number of application DLLs.  Similarly, a single application DLL may serve a number of SRF files.

The simplest SRF file must contain one or more references to application DLLs and one or more calls to a functions within those DLLs.  A simple SRF file would look something like this:

The first line of the file:

is used to identify the DLL and the class that the SRF file will make calls to.

Within the file, function calls would look like this:

In the above case, the ATLServerHelloWorld.dll DLL contains a definition of a "Default" class as shown below:

Note the use of the request_handler attribute on the class to identify that this is the "Default" class and also note the use of tag_name attribute to identify the "HelloWorld" method.
