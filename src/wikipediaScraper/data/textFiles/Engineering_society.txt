An engineering society is a professional organization for engineers of various disciplines . Some are umbrella type organizations which accept many different disciplines, while others are discipline-specific. Many award professional designations, such as European Engineer , professional engineer , chartered engineer , incorporated engineer or similar. There are also many student-run engineering societies, commonly at universities or technical colleges.
