The American Solar Challenge (ASC), previously known as the North American Solar Challenge and Sunrayce , is a solar car race across the United States. In the race, teams from colleges and universities throughout North America design, build, test, and race solar-powered vehicles in a long distance road rally -style event. ASC is a test of teamwork, engineering skill, and endurance that stretches across thousands of miles of public roads.

The competition occurs every two years in the summer of even years. ASC 2020 was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

Originally called Sunrayce USA , the first race was organized and sponsored by General Motors in 1990 in an effort to promote automotive engineering and solar energy among college students. At the time, GM had just won the inaugural World Solar Challenge in Australia in 1987; rather than continue actively racing, it instead opted to sponsor collegiate events.

Subsequent races were held in 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1999 under the name Sunrayce [year] (e.g. Sunrayce 93 ). In 2001, the race was renamed American Solar Challenge and was sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory . Beginning in 2005, its name changed again to North American Solar Challenge , in order to reflect the border crossing into Canada and the addition of co-sponsor Natural Resources Canada . The name was changed back to ASC in 2010.

After the 2005 race, the U.S. Department of Energy discontinued its sponsorship, resulting in no scheduled race for 2007. Sponsorship was taken over for NASC 2008 by Toyota . The American Solar Challenge is now governed by the Innovators Educational Foundation .

The original, 1,800 mi (2,900 km) Sunrayce USA route started at Disney World in Orlando, Florida and ended at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. The winner of the first race was the University of Michigan Solar Car Team 's Sunrunner , with an average speed of 24.7 mph (39.8 km/h), followed by Western Washington University's Viking XX .

The 2005 race, renamed the North American Solar Challenge , was both the longest and most hotly contested race in the history of the event. The route covered 2,494.9 mi (4,015.2 km), taking the teams from Austin, Texas in the United States to Calgary , Alberta in Canada. The race was won by the Momentum from the University of Michigan with an average speed of 46.2 mph (74.4 km/h). The University of Minnesota 's Borealis III followed in second place less than 12 minutes behind, with an average speed of 46.0 mph (74.0 km/h). The lead teams often drove 65 mph (105 km/h) (the maximum allowed), but were slowed by rain in Kansas and 20 mph (32 km/h) headwinds in Canada. Stanford University 's Solstice won the Stock Class, followed in second place by the Beam Machine from The University of California, Berkeley .

The 2008 North American Solar Challenge took place on July 13–22, 2008, mostly along the 2005 route from Dallas , Texas to Calgary , Alberta . The University of Michigan's Continuum won the race with a total elapsed time of 51 hours, 41 minutes, and 53 seconds, marking that school's fifth victory. Ra 7 from Principia College followed in second place.

As many of the top cars were bumping up against the 65 mph (105 km/h) race speed limit in the 2005 event, race rules were changed for 2008 order to improve safety and limit performance. Open class cars are now only allowed 6 square meters of active cell area, and upright seating is required for both open and stock class cars. The changes were carried over from the 2007 World Solar Challenge .
