AM 50 is a Czech automatically launched assault bridge used by combat engineers for crossing narrow obstacles such as rivers, canals, and ditches. It is mounted on heavy vehicles (such as the unarmored or lightly armored Tatra 815 8×8 truck), and can bridge a gap up to 52 meters (170 feet 7 inches).

The AM 50 was developed for the Czechoslovak Army in the late 1960s. Today it is in use in the Czech Republic , Slovakia , India and Pakistan .
