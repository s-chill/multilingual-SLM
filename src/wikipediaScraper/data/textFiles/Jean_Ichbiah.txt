Ichbiah's team submitted a language design labelled "Green" to a competition to choose the United States Department of Defense 's embedded programming language. When Green was selected in 1978, he continued as chief designer of the language, now named " Ada ". In 1980, Ichbiah left CII-HB and founded the Alsys corporation in La Celle-Saint-Cloud , which continued language definition to standardize Ada 83, and later went into the Ada compiler business, also supplying special validated compiler systems to NASA , the US Army , and others.

In the 1990s, Ichbiah designed the keyboard layout FITALY , which is specifically optimized for stylus or touch-based input . Subsequently, he started the Textware Solutions company, which sells text entry software for PDAs and tablet PCs , as well as text-entry software for medical transcription on PCs.
