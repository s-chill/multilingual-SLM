The tonne of oil equivalent ( toe ) is a unit of energy defined as the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil . It is approximately 42 gigajoules or 11.630 megawatt-hours , although as different crude oils have different calorific values , the exact value is defined by convention; several slightly different definitions exist. The toe is sometimes used for large amounts of energy .

Multiples of the toe are used, in particular the megatoe (Mtoe, one million toe) and the gigatoe (Gtoe, one billion toe). A smaller unit of kilogram of oil equivalent ( kgoe or koe ) is also sometimes used denoting 1/1000 toe.

The International Energy Agency defines one tonne of oil equivalent (toe) to be equal to:

Conversion into other units:

Some other sources and publications use divergent definitions of toe, for example:

Tonne of oil equivalent should be used carefully when converting electrical units. For instance, BP's 2022 report used a factor of 40% efficiency (the average efficiency of a standard thermal power plant in 2017), or roughly 16.8 GJ per toe, when converting kilowatt-hours to toe. BP's model is also based on the assumption that efficiency will increase linearly to 45% by 2050.

For multiples of the tonne of oil equivalent, it is more usual to speak of millions of tonnes of oil equivalent and kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe).
