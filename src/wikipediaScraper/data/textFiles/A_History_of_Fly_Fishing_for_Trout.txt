A History of Fly Fishing for Trout is a fly fishing book written by John Waller Hills published in London in 1921.

A History of Fly Fishing for Trout is the first book to trace the history of fly fishing from its very beginning, with chapters on Early Sporting Literature, Early Fly Fishing in France, and identifying all the artificial flies mentioned by early writers. The book includes a useful bibliography for scholars interested in further historical research.

It covers the period from the close of the 15th century to the beginning of the 20th, from the Treatyse to Andrew Lang.  The story is very well told and must have involved considerable research.  Generous in his appreciations, he can always be relied upon to give an unbiased judgement.  The book sets a high standard and one can refer to him with confidence on moot points in angling literature on trout fly-fishing.

All three of these writers—Robb, Hills and Marston—get at the real meaning of the old writers, quote them and characterize them, point out the significance of their contributions, and show both where they are still valid and where later developments have improved them.
