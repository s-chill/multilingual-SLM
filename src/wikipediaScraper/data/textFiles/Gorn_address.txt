A Gorn address (Gorn, 1967) is a method of identifying and addressing any node within a tree data structure . This notation is often used for identifying nodes in a parse tree defined by phrase structure rules .

The Gorn address is a sequence of zero or more integers conventionally separated by dots, e.g., 0 or 1.0.1 . 
The root which Gorn calls * can be regarded as the empty sequence. 
And the j {\displaystyle j} -th child of the i {\displaystyle i} -th child has an address i . j {\displaystyle i.j} , counting from 0.

It is named after American computer scientist Saul Gorn .
