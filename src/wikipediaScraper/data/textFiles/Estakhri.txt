Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Farisi al-Istakhri ( آبو إسحاق إبراهيم بن محمد الفارسي الإصطخري ) (also Estakhri , Persian : استخری , i.e. from the Iranian city of Istakhr , b. - d. 346 AH/AD 957) was a 10th-century travel author and Islamic geographer who wrote valuable accounts in Arabic of the many Muslim territories he visited during the Abbasid era of the Islamic Golden Age . There is no consensus regarding his origin. Some sources describe him as Persian , while others state he was Arab . The Encyclopedia Iranica states: "Biographical data are very meager. From his nesbas (attributive names) he appears to have been a native of Eṣṭaḵr in Fārs, but it is not known whether he was Persian".

Istakhri's account of windmills is the earliest known. Istakhri met the celebrated traveller-geographer Ibn Hawqal , while travelling, and Ibn Hawqal incorporated the work of Istakhri in his book Kitab al-Surat al-Ard .

Istakhri's two surviving works are:

An 8-volume edition of works by medieval Arab geographers, edited by the Dutch orientalist Michael Jan de Goeje in a series titled Bibliotheca geographorum Arabicorum was published by Brill, Lugduni-Batavora (Leiden) in the 1870s.  An edition of Istakhri's MS text was produced for the first volume under the Latin title Viae Regnorum descriptio ditionis Moslemicae - "Description of Roads of the Kingdoms in Muslim territories". In 1927, the editor Theodore Noldeke produced a second edition.

In 1845, the German orientalist A. D. Mordtmann published a translation in Hamburg with the title Das Buch der Länder von Schech Ebu Ishak el Farsi el Isztachri , with a foreword by C. Ritter. (Schriften der Akademie von Ham Bd. 1, Abth. 2).
