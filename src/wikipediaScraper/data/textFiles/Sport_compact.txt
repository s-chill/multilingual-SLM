Sport compact is a United States marketing classification for a high-performance version of a compact or a subcompact car . There is no precise definition, and the description is applied to various models for promotional purposes.

Cars began to be marketed as sport compacts in the mid-1980s to describe the option packages on American-built coupes. Since then, it has also been used for standalone sports car models and cars imported from Europe and Asia.

The European equivalent is a hot hatch . However, sport compacts are not limited to hatchback body styles.

A sports compact should "fulfill the multiple duties of a family car, plaything, and daily driver". Many sports compacts have coupe, sedan, or hatchback body styles built on mass-production platforms. Other common (but not essential) characteristics include front-wheel or all-wheel drive , a four-cylinder internal-combustion engine, suspension tuned for handling , and bodywork designed to improve aerodynamics or allow for larger wheels.

"Econosport" is a rarely used term for a sports version of a small economy car.

An early sport compact was the 1968 Ford Capri , a European coupe built on the platform of the second-generation Ford Cortina sedans.

The early American-built sport compact models contained optional performance or sporting packages for mass-produced compact coupes in the 1980s. Examples include the 1986 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24, the 1986 Ford EXP Sport Coupe, the 1987 Renault Alliance GTA, and the 1988 Plymouth Sundance . These models achieved moderate sales. Sport compact models gained greater prominence by the mid-1990s, sold in significant numbers in models such as the 1993 Ford Probe (based on the Mazda MX-6 platform), and the 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier / Pontiac Sunfire badge-engineered twins.

Sports compacts of the 2000s include the 2001-2003 Ford ZX2 , the 2004-2007 Saturn Ion Red Line , the 2005-2010 Chevrolet Cobalt SS , and the 2003-2005 Dodge Neon SRT-4 .

European hot hatches are considered 'sport compact' cars in the North American market. Examples include the 1976-present Volkswagen Golf GTI and the 2000-present Mini Cooper. Similarly, most Japanese hot hatches and sports coupes are classified as 'sport compact' cars when sold in North America, for example, the 1984-present Honda Civic Si , 2007-2013 Mazdaspeed3 , and the 2012-present Toyota 86 .

Sport compact cars are often used in motorsport events because they are relatively lightweight. They are used to compete in various types of motorsport, including autocross , rallying , rallycross , touring car racing , drifting , and drag racing .

From 2005 through 2012, the International Sport Compact Auto Racing Series was an American stock car racing series for sports compacts that mostly raced on paved oval racetracks.
