RoboSapien is a toy-like biomorphic robot designed by Mark Tilden and produced by WowWee toys. Released in 2004, the Robosapien is preprogrammed with moves, and also can be controlled by an infrared remote control included or by a PDA . The product sold over 1.5 million units between April and December 2004, and was named "Toy of the Year" by the Toy Retailers Association .

The toy is capable of a walking motion without recourse to wheels within its feet. It can grasp objects with either of its hands, and throw grasped objects. It has a small loudspeaker unit, which can broadcast several different vocalizations . The robot uses seven motors, and maintains balance by using "two trianges", one inverted above the over. As the lower part of the body leans to one side, balance is maintained by titling the upper half to match.

The robot's remote control unit has a total of 21 different buttons. With the help of two shift buttons, a total of 67 different robot-executable commands are accessible.

Germany Openen 2005 tournament two teams of three Robosapiens each played the first Soccer match of humanoid robots worldwide. University of Osnabr√ºck played against a team from Albert Ludwig's University of Freiburg . Replacing the head by a PDA allowed the robot to perceive its environment with a camera, a control program could then react to this via the PDA's infrared sender.

Other research involving RoboSapien includes using it to model the behaviour of humanoid robots in dangerous manufacturing environments.
