Corrado Böhm (17 January 1923 – 23 October 2017) was an Italian computer scientist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Rome "La Sapienza" , known especially for his contributions to the theory of structured programming , constructive mathematics , combinatory logic , lambda calculus , and the semantics and implementation of functional programming languages.

In his PhD dissertation (in Mathematics, at ETH Zurich, 1951; published in 1954), Böhm describes for the first time a full meta-circular compiler , that is a translation mechanism of a programming language, written in that same language. His most influential contribution is the so-called structured program theorem , published in 1966 together with Giuseppe Jacopini. Together with Alessandro Berarducci, he demonstrated an isomorphism between the strictly-positive algebraic data types and the polymorphic lambda-terms, otherwise known as Böhm–Berarducci encoding.

In the lambda calculus , he established an important separation theorem between normal forms, known as Böhm's theorem , which states that for every two closed λ-terms T 1 and T 2 which have different βη-normal forms, there exists a term Δ where Δ T 1 and Δ T 2 evaluate to different free variables (i.e., they may be taken apart internally). This means that, for normalizing terms, Morris' contextual equivalence , which is a semantic property, may be decided through equality of normal forms, a syntactic property, as it coincides with βη-equality.

A special issue of Theoretical Computer Science was dedicated to him in 1993, on his 70th birthday. He is the recipient of the 2001 EATCS Award for a distinguished career in theoretical computer science.
