In publishing and library and information science , the term serial is applied to materials "in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion."

This includes the literary serial , where a story is published in several parts, but also all kinds of periodicals such as magazines and journals.

Periodicals are publications that are issued on a regular basis. Some of the examples of periodicals are weekly magazines , journals , Trade publications and newspapers . Each type of periodicals has its own characteristics and purpose.

In contrast to serials in general, a periodical has been defined as "A serial publication with its own distinctive title, containing a mix of articles  ... by more than one contributor, issued ... at regular stated intervals of less than a year, without prior decision as to when the final issue will appear." Thus a periodical does not admit irregularly spaced publication times. This includes magazines and journals , but not proceedings , but traditionally excludes newspapers . Thus all periodicals are serials but not all serials are periodicals.
