The architecture of Quebec City is characterized by its being one of the oldest cities of Northern America , founded in 1608. The French settlers of the area built in an architectural style similar to that of their native France . Quebec City is the only remaining fortified city north of Mexico and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985.

Quebec City has significant secular architecture, including hundreds of surviving heritage homes which have been built in the particular style of New France . This style is based on 17th- and 18th-century house forms of Normandy and elsewhere in the north of France, adapted to the colder winter climate of Quebec.

Quebec has always been a predominantly Roman Catholic city and contains a number of notable Catholic churches, including the Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral and Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church ; in addition, the massive Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré is located 30 km (19 mi) outside the city.
