Ciena was founded in 1992 under the name HydraLite by electrical engineer David R. Huber . Huber served as chief executive officer, while his former employer, Optelecom , an optical networking company, provided "management assistance and production facilities," and co-founder Kevin Kimberlin "provided initial equity capital during the formation of the Company". Dave Huber engaged William K. Woodruff & Co. to raise $3.0 million in venture funding in September of 1993. Woodruff presented the idea to John Bayless at Sevin Rosen in November 1993 that resulted in Sevin Rosen investing $3.0 million April 10, 1994. William K. Woodruff & Co. was a co-manager of Ciena's IPO in February 1997. The company subsequently received funding from Sevin Rosen Funds as a result of a demonstration at its laboratory attended by Jon Bayless, a partner at the firm, who saw the value in applying HydraLite's fiber-optic technology to cable television. Sevin Rosen offered funding immediately, investing $1.25 million in April 1994.

Ciena received $40 million in venture capital financing , including $3.3 million from Sevin Rosen Funds. Other early investors in the company included Charles River Ventures , Japan Associated Finance Co., Star Venture, and Vanguard Venture Partners. Bayless also recruited physicist Patrick Nettles, a former colleague at the telecommunications company Optilink, to serve as Ciena's first CEO, and Lawrence P. Huang, another former colleague, to accept the sales chief role. Huber and Nettles, who changed the company's name to Ciena, began working from an office in Dallas in February 1994; Huber would remain with Ciena until 1995.

The name of the company was changed to Ciena in 1994. Its first products were introduced in May 1996 to Sprint Corporation. At $195 million, the company's first-year sales were the highest ever recorded by a startup at the time with $54.8 million from Sprint alone by November 1996. WorldCom also became an early customer. As of early 1997, Sprint and WorldCom accounted for 97 percent of Ciena's revenue. Ciena began diversifying its clientele and acquiring smaller contracts in 1997.

Ciena went public on NASDAQ in February 1997 with initial public offering by a startup company to date, with a valuation of $3.4 billion.

In March 1998, Nettles and Michael Birck of Tellabs began discussing a possible merger. Tellabs announced the purchase of Ciena for $7.1 billion in June.

The merger was called off. in September 1998 with financial performance and shareholder disapproval cited in the media as reasons.

To address the company's challenges this presented, Gary Smith replaced Nettles as the company's CEO in 2001, and Nettles became executive chairman. The company raised $1.52 billion by selling 11 million shares of stock and $600 million in convertible bonds in 2001. Ciena was the second largest fiber optic networking equipment producer in the U.S. at the time.

While many telecommunications companies experienced downturns during the early 2000s, Ciena's cash influx provided flexibility and allowed the company to expand its product portfolio to include a broader range of advanced networking solutions and other technologies. Ciena also completed a series of strategic acquisitions, buying 11 companies between 1997 and early 2004, spending more than $2 billion to purchase five networking technology companies during 2001–2004.
