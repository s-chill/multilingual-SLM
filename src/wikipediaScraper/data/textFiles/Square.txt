In cryptography , Square (sometimes written S QUARE )  is a block cipher invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen . The design, published in 1997, is a forerunner to Rijndael , which has been adopted as the Advanced Encryption Standard . Square was introduced together with a new form of cryptanalysis discovered by Lars Knudsen , called the " Square attack ".

The structure of Square is a substitutionâ€“permutation network with eight rounds, operating on 128-bit blocks and using a 128-bit key .

Square is not patented.
