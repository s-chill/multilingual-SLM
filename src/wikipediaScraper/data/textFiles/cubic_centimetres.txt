One cubic centimetre corresponds to a volume of one millilitre .  The mass of one cubic centimetre of water at 3.98 °C (the temperature at which it attains its maximum density ) is almost equal to one gram.

In internal combustion engines , "cc" refers to the total volume of its engine displacement in cubic centimetres. The displacement can be calculated using the formula

where d is engine displacement, b is the bore of the cylinders, s is length of the stroke and n is the number of cylinders.
