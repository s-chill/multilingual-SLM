Underground soft-rock mining is a group of underground mining techniques used to extract coal , oil shale , potash , and other minerals or geological materials from sedimentary ("soft") rocks. Because deposits in sedimentary rocks are commonly layered and relatively less hard , the mining methods used differ from those used to mine deposits in igneous or metamorphic rocks (see underground hard-rock mining ). Underground mining techniques also differ greatly from those of surface mining .
