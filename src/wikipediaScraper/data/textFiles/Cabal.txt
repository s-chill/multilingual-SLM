The Haskell Cabal ( c ommon a rchitecture for b uilding a pplications and l ibraries )  aids in the packaging and distribution of software packages .

Cabal was introduced to simplify packaging of Haskell software and modules . It was added to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler in version 6.4 as the default package manager, (alongside GHC's internal manager "ghc-pkg"). Its approach has changed significantly over the course of its development, moving from global package installation to sandboxed builds, and eventually a Nix -inspired solution of local builds with global caching, which became the default in 2019.

Cabal packages provide a standard set of metadata and build process; thus, it is possible to develop tools to upload Cabal packages to the CPAN -like community repository of software, Hackage , or even allow for automated downloading, compilation, and installation of desired packages from Hackage.
