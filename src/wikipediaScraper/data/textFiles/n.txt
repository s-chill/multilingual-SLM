An n -gram is a sequence of n adjacent symbols in particular order. The symbols may be n adjacent letters (including punctuation marks and blanks), syllables , or rarely whole words found in a language dataset; or adjacent phonemes extracted from a speech-recording dataset, or adjacent base pairs extracted from a genome. They are collected from a text corpus or speech corpus .  If Latin numerical prefixes are used, then n -gram of size 1 is called a "unigram", size 2 a " bigram " (or, less commonly, a "digram") etc. If, instead of the Latin ones, the English cardinal numbers are furtherly used, then they are called "four-gram", "five-gram", etc. Similarly, using Greek numerical prefixes such as "monomer", "dimer", "trimer", "tetramer", "pentamer", etc., or English cardinal numbers, "one-mer", "two-mer", "three-mer", etc. are used in computational biology, for polymers or oligomers of a known size, called k -mers . When the items are words, n -grams may also be called shingles .

In the context of Natural language processing (NLP), the use of n -grams allows bag-of-words models to capture information such as word order, which would not be possible in the traditional bag of words setting.

(Shannon 1951) discussed n -gram models of English. For example:

Figure 1 shows several example sequences and the corresponding 1-gram, 2-gram and 3-gram sequences.

Here are further examples; these are word-level 3-grams and 4-grams (and counts of the number of times they appeared) from the Google n -gram corpus.
