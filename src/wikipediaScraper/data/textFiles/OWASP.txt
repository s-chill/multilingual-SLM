The Open Worldwide Application Security Project ( OWASP ) is an online community that produces freely available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the fields of IoT , system software and web application security . The OWASP provides free and open resources. It is led by a non-profit called The OWASP Foundation. The OWASP Top 10 - 2021 is the published result of recent research based on comprehensive data compiled from over 40 partner organizations.

Mark Curphey started OWASP on September 9, 2001. Jeff Williams served as the volunteer Chair of OWASP from late 2003 until September 2011. As of 2015 , Matt Konda chaired the Board.

The OWASP Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in the US established in 2004, supports the OWASP infrastructure and projects. Since 2011, OWASP is also registered as a non-profit organization in Belgium under the name of OWASP Europe VZW.

In February 2023, it was reported by Bil Corry, a OWASP Foundation Global Board of Directors officer, on Twitter that the board had voted for renaming from the Open Web Application Security Project to its current name, replacing Web with Worldwide.

The OWASP organization received the 2014 Haymarket Media Group SC Magazine Editor's Choice award.
