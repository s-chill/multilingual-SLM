The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour or SSAISB or AISB is a nonprofit, scientific society devoted to advancing the scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behaviour and their simulation and embodiment in machines . AISB also aims to facilitate co-operation and communication among those interested in the study of artificial intelligence , simulation of behaviour and the design of intelligent systems.

Founded in 1964, AISB is the oldest artificial intelligence society in the world, and the largest within the United Kingdom . The society has an international membership drawn from both academia and industry. It is a member of the European Association for Artificial Intelligence (previously known as European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence ECCAI ).

The objectives of the Society are:

The society hosts an annual convention consisting of parallel symposia covering various specialist topics, loosely organised around a theme.
It also runs various events, especially to promote public understanding of AI and cognitive science .
The society published the journal AISBJ (no longer published) and continues to publish a quarterly newsletter AISBQ which includes short reports on current AI and cognitive science research.
