It often contains a copyright notice , legal notices, publication information, printing history, cataloguing information from a national library , and an ISBN that uniquely identifies the work.

At the bottom of the edition notice one often finds a line of numbers, some of which may appear to be missing, called the printer's key .  These indicate the book's print run .

Sometimes, there will also be a warning indicating that the book sold without a cover is a stripped book .
