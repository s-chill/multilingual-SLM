In a positive review, The Observer ' s Rob Black Anges Water wrote, " Hook, Line and Sinker has become one of Australia's most popular fishing shows, with a bit of lifestyle and cooking mixed in with an irreverent blend of humour setting it apart from some of the more traditional programs." Phillip Ellerton of The Mercury said, "Although some purists may not enjoy the Hook, Line and Sinker DVDs, they offer a fresh, exciting and often humorous approach to fishing." Writing in The Mercury , Rohan Wade stated, "While not always madcap, the antics of Hart and Duigan are often more about good humour than good fishing, but it is a style that is winning over viewers as an alternative to the super-slick, highly produced interstate fishing shows that produce a steady stream of fish."
