Surface-water hydrology is the sub-field of hydrology concerned with above-earth water ( surface water ), in contrast to groundwater hydrology that deals with water below the surface of the Earth. Its applications include rainfall and runoff , the routes that surface water takes (for example through rivers or reservoirs ), and the occurrence of floods and droughts. Surface-water hydrology is used to predict the effects of water constructions such as dams and canals. It considers the layout of the watershed , geology , soils , vegetation, nutrients, energy and wildlife. Modelled aspects include precipitation , the interception of rain water by vegetation or artificial structures, evaporation , the runoff function and the soil-surface system itself.

When surface water seeps into the ground above bedrock, it is categorized as groundwater , and the rate at which this occurs determines baseflow needs for instream flow , as well as subsurface water levels in wells . While groundwater is not part of surface-water hydrology, it must be taken into account for a full understanding of the behaviour of surface water.

Glacial hydrology is a part of surface-water hydrology; some of the runoff from glaciers and snow also involves groundwater hydrology concepts.
