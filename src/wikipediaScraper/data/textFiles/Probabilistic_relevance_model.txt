The probabilistic relevance model was devised by Stephen E. Robertson and Karen Spärck Jones as a framework for probabilistic models to come. It is a formalism of information retrieval useful to derive ranking functions used by search engines and web search engines in order to rank matching documents according to their relevance to a given search query.

It is a theoretical model estimating the probability that a document d j is relevant to a query q . The model assumes that this probability of relevance depends on the query and document representations. Furthermore, it assumes that there is a portion of all documents that is preferred by the user as the answer set for query q . Such an ideal answer set is called R and should maximize the overall probability of relevance to that user. The prediction is that documents in this set R are relevant to the query, while documents not present in the set are non-relevant.

s i m ( d j , q ) = P ( R | d → j ) P ( R ¯ | d → j ) {\displaystyle sim(d_{j},q)={\frac {P(R|{\vec {d}}_{j})}{P({\bar {R}}|{\vec {d}}_{j})}}}

There are some limitations to this framework that need to be addressed by further development:

To address these and other concerns, other models have been developed from the probabilistic relevance framework, among them the Binary Independence Model from the same author. The best-known derivative of this framework is the Okapi (BM25) weighting scheme, along with BM25F, a modification thereof.
