Ona is a village and an island group located in Ålesund Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway . The tiny island of Ona and the larger island of Husøy are separated by a shallow 15-metre (49 ft) wide waterway. The two islands are collectively referred to as Ona . The islands are located 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) northwest of the island of Sandøya .

The historic village of Ona covers most of the tiny island of Ona. The highest point on Ona, the Onakalven cliff, is the site of the Ona Lighthouse , which was built in 1867. The lighthouse and the tiny island itself has become a well known tourist spot in Western Norway . It has a ferry connection with the other islands in Sandøy and to the island of Gossa in Aukra Municipality .

The island has a population of about 40, with a gradually diminishing population for the last 50 years. Ona has been populated for centuries because of the proximity to the fishing grounds further out to the Atlantic Ocean , and fishing has traditionally been the only source of income. Lately, several pottery artists have moved to the island.

Ona was featured, along with "Morning Song" by Babe Rainbow , in the Allstate Insurance Company's (U.S.) television commercial in 2020.

Ona has an oceanic climate ( Köppen : Cfb ) with cool/mild summers and chilly winters with lots of rainfall.
