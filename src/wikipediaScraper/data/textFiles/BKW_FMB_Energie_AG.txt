BKW Energie AG ( BKW ; formerly known as Bernische Kraftwerke AG ) is a power production and distribution utility with its headquarters in Bern , Switzerland . It also provides gas and heat through a number of subsidiaries or partner companies. It mainly operates in the canton of Bern , but is also present in Italy , Germany and Austria .

BKW was founded in 1898 as Aktiengesellschaft Elektrizitätswerk Hagneck . The name was changed to Bernische Kraftwerke AG in 1909. In 1995, it changed to its present name. BKW FMB Energie AG , to emphasize the internationalization of the company's business plan.

It has been quoted on the BX Swiss since 1969. As from 2003, it is also present at the Swiss Stock Exchange . The largest shareholder is the canton of Bern , with 52.54%. The Swiss energy provider Groupe E SA holds a further 10% of BKW. Although the German power company E.ON Energie AG once also had a large stake (20.99% share as of 2007), in 2010 it began selling off its share of BKW. By 2014 E.ON had only 6.7 of BKW and took steps to sell its remaining stake via exchangeable bonds, completing its divestiture by October of that year.

Since 2013 the board chair of BKW Group has been Roger Baillod. The CEO is Robert Itschner, who took over from Suzanne Thoma in late 2022. Head of finances is Martin Zwyssig.

In its annual report for 2022, BKW reported revenue of CHF 5.199 billion, an increase of 46% over 2021, and record-high earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of CHF 1.038 billion (+163% over 2021). Net profit increased 191% to CHF 712.9 million. The total employee count grew by some 800 new workers to 11,500.

With a yearly energy sale of 24.2 TW⋅h the BKW is one of the biggest Swiss power utilities. Of this, 9.7 TW⋅h is produced by own plants or by shares in other facilities. As of 2007 the mix is mainly composed of nuclear (61.87%) and hydroelectric (37.96%) power. The remainder is produced by renewable sources like solar, wind, or biomass. Due to the necessity to diversify the mix and satisfy the increasing demand, BKW is introducing some fossil fuel power through shares in abroad plants.

In 2008 a new 800 MW combined cycle gas power plant started operation in Livorno Ferraris ( province of Vercelli , Italy). BKW possesses a 25% share.

BKW produces up to 52% of its power through owned or shared hydroelectric plants in Switzerland and Italy.

In the 2020s, the Mühleberg Nuclear Power Plant will probably cease its activity and the contracts for importing nuclear energy from France will expire. BKW and Axpo founded Resun AG to prevent the consequent energy lack. Its purpose is to manage the administrative procedure for building two new nuclear plants up to 1600 MW each.

BKW provides around one million people in 400 municipalities in Bern Canton and surroundings with power, through its local and distribution networks of up to 132 kV. It also owns 665 km of 220 kV and 56 km of 380 kV lines, although their operation is entrusted to the national transmission company Swissgrid AG .
