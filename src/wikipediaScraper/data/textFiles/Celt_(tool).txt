In archaeology , a celt / ˈ s ɛ l t / is a long, thin, prehistoric , stone or bronze tool similar to an adze , hoe , or axe .

A shoe-last celt was a polished stone tool used during the early European Neolithic for felling trees and woodworking.

The term "celt" seems to have come about from a copyist's error in many medieval manuscript copies of Job 19:24 in the Latin Vulgate Bible, which became enshrined in the authoritative Sixto-Clementine printed edition of 1592. Where all earlier versions (the Codex Amiatinus , for example) have vel certe (the Latin for 'but surely'), the Sixto-Clementine has vel celte . The Hebrew has לעד ( lā‘aḏ ) at this point, which means 'forever'. The editors of the Oxford English Dictionary "[incline] to the belief that celtis was a phantom word", simply a misspelling of certe . However, some scholars over the years have treated celtis as a real Latin word.

From the context of Job 19:24 ("Oh, that my words were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!"), the Latin word celte was assumed to be some kind of ancient chisel . Eighteenth-century antiquarians , such as Lorenz Beger [ de ; fr ] , adopted the word for the stone and bronze tools they were finding at prehistoric sites; the OED suggests that a "fancied etymological connexion" with the prehistoric Celts assisted its passage into common use.
