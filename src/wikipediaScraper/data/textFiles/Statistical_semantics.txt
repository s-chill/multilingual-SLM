In linguistics , statistical semantics applies the methods of statistics to the problem of determining the meaning of words or phrases, ideally through unsupervised learning , to a degree of precision at least sufficient for the purpose of information retrieval .

The term statistical semantics was first used by Warren Weaver in his well-known paper on machine translation . He argued that word sense disambiguation for machine translation should be based on the co-occurrence frequency of the context words near a given target word. The underlying assumption that "a word is characterized by the company it keeps" was advocated by J.R. Firth . This assumption is known in linguistics as the distributional hypothesis . Emile Delavenay defined statistical semantics as the "statistical study of the meanings of words and their frequency and order of recurrence". " Furnas et al. 1983" is frequently cited as a foundational contribution to statistical semantics. An early success in the field was latent semantic analysis .

Research in statistical semantics has resulted in a wide variety of algorithms that use the distributional hypothesis to discover many aspects of semantics , by applying statistical techniques to large corpora :

Statistical semantics focuses on the meanings of common words and the relations between common words, unlike text mining , which tends to focus on whole documents, document collections, or named entities (names of people, places, and organizations). Statistical semantics is a subfield of computational semantics , which is in turn a subfield of computational linguistics and natural language processing .

Many of the applications of statistical semantics (listed above) can also be addressed by lexicon -based algorithms, instead of the corpus -based algorithms of statistical semantics. One advantage of corpus-based algorithms is that they are typically not as labour-intensive as lexicon-based algorithms. Another advantage is that they are usually easier to adapt to new languages or noisier new text types from e.g. social media than lexicon-based algorithms are. However, the best performance on an application is often achieved by combining the two approaches.
