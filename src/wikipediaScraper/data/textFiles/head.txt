head is a program on Unix and Unix-like operating systems used to display the beginning  of a text file or piped data.

The command syntax is:

By default, head will print the first 10 lines of its input to the standard output .

This displays the first 5 lines of all files starting with foo :

Many early versions of Unix and Plan 9 did not have this command, and documentation and books used sed instead:

The example prints every line (implicit) and quit after the fifth.

Equivalently, awk may be used to print the first five lines in a file:

However, neither sed nor awk were available in early versions of BSD , which were based on Version 6 Unix , and included head.

A head command is also part of ASCII 's MSX-DOS2 Tools for MSX-DOS version 2. The head command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.
