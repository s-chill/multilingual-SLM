A pulk (from Sami languages : puhlke , via Finnish : pulkka ; Swedish : pulka ; Norwegian : pulk ; Northern Sami : bulki ) is a Nordic short, low-slung small sled used in sport or for transport, pulled by a dog or a skier , or in Sápmi pulled by reindeer . They are classically made out of wood and other natural materials but are nowadays made of plastic, which makes them inexpensive.

Pulks are originally meant to carry supplies such as a tent or food, or transport a child or other person. In Norway and Sweden, pulks are often used by parents to pull small children on skiing trips. In Finland and Sweden, pulks exist as a winter toy, mainly for children, for going downhill. Besides the classic toy pulk there are similar alternatives like " saucers " (pulks shaped like a disc), as well as sleighs of different configurations.

A larger pulk, designed for transporting larger amounts of goods, is called ahkio [ɑhkio] in Finnish. This word is also used by the US Army for a human-drawn snow sled.
