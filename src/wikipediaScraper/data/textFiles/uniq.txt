uniq is a utility command on Unix , Plan 9 , Inferno , and Unix-like operating systems which, when fed a text file or standard input , outputs the text with adjacent identical lines collapsed to one, unique line of text.

The command is a kind of filter program . Typically it is used after sort . It can also output only the duplicate lines (with the -d option), or add the number of occurrences of each line (with the -c option). For example, the following command lists the unique lines in a file, sorted by the number of times each occurs:

Using uniq like this is common when building pipelines in shell scripts .

First appearing in Version 3 Unix , uniq is now available for a number of different Unix and Unix-like operating systems . It is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX and the Single Unix Specification .

The version bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Richard Stallman and David MacKenzie.

A uniq command is also part of ASCII 's MSX-DOS2 Tools for MSX-DOS version 2.

The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the GnuWin32 project and the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

The uniq command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.
