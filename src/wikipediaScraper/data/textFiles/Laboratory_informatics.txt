Laboratory informatics is the specialized application of information technology aimed at optimizing and extending laboratory operations. It encompasses data acquisition (e.g. through sensors and hardware or voice ), instrument interfacing, laboratory networking, data processing , specialized data management systems (such as a chromatography data system ), a laboratory information management system , scientific data management (including data mining and data warehousing ), and knowledge management (including the use of an electronic lab notebook ). It has become more prevalent with the rise of other " informatics " disciplines such as bioinformatics , cheminformatics and health informatics . Several graduate programs are focused on some form of laboratory informatics, often with a clinical emphasis. A closely related - some consider subsuming - field is laboratory automation .

In the context of Public Health Laboratories, the Association of Public Health Laboratories has identified 19 areas for self-assessment of laboratory informatics in their Laboratories Efficiencies Initiative. These include the following Capability Areas.
