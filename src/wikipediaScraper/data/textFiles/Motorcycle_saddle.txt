A motorcycle seat (sometimes saddle ) is where rider sits, and may also accommodate a passenger.

The most common type of motorcycle seat is a dual saddle or bench seat, which runs along the top of the chassis and is long enough for a pillion passenger to straddle the motorcycle behind the rider. Two detached seats, rather than one elongated one, were more common until the mid 20th century. A single, or solo, seat is only large enough for the rider. They are typical of racing , off-road , and many historic motorcycles. In motorcycle trials , the bikes have no seating at all, as the rider remains standing on the footpegs for the entire competition.
