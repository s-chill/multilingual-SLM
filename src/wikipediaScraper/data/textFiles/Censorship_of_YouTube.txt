Censorship of video-sharing platform YouTube occurs to varying degrees in many countries.

YouTube blocking occurs for a variety of reasons including:

In some countries YouTube is completely blocked, either through a long-term standing ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In other countries, access to the website as a whole remains open, but access to specific videos is blocked due to many reasons including orders from country jurisdiction. In both cases, a VPN is usually deployed to bypass geographical restrictions. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service.

As of September 2012, countries with standing national bans on YouTube include China , Iran , and Turkmenistan . Due to disputes between GEMA and YouTube over royalties, many videos featuring copyrighted songs were inaccessible in Germany . After an agreement was made between the companies in November 2016, these videos became accessible.

YouTube's Terms of Service prohibit the posting of videos which violate copyrights or depict pornography, promoting racism, illegal acts, gratuitous violence, or hate speech . User-posted videos that violate such terms may be removed and replaced with a message stating: "This video is no longer available because its content violated YouTube's Terms of Service". Additionally, Google reserves the right to terminate any account for any reason, even without notice.

YouTube offers an opt-in feature known as "Restricted Mode", which filters videos that might contain mature content.

YouTube was first blocked in China for over five months from October 16, 2007 to March 22, 2008.

It was blocked again from March 24, 2009, although a Foreign Ministry spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny whether YouTube had been blocked. Since then, YouTube has been inaccessible from mainland China . However, YouTube can still be accessed from Hong Kong (via a local version), Macau (via a worldwide version), the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone , specific hotels, and by using a VPN. Since 2018, when the term "YouTube" is searched on Baidu , the following message is displayed: "According to local regulations and policies, some results cannot be shown."

Even though YouTube is blocked under the Great Firewall , many Chinese media outlets, including China Central Television (CCTV) , have official YouTube accounts. Despite the ban, Alexa ranks YouTube as the 5th-most-visited website in China.

YouTube has been intermittently blocked in Eritrea since 2011 by some ISPs, although a spokesperson for Freedom House speculated this was due to bandwidth considerations.

On December 3, 2006, Iran temporarily blocked access to YouTube and several other sites, after declaring them as violators of social and moral codes of conduct. The YouTube block came after a video was posted online that appeared to show an Iranian soap opera star having sex. The block was later lifted and then reinstated after Iran's 2009 presidential election . In 2012, Iran reblocked access, along with access to Google, after the controversial film Innocence of Muslims trailer was released on YouTube. Some startups, television shows, celebrities, and reformist politicians such as Khatami use this website.

YouTube was blocked in North Korea because of the country's laws regarding the Internet and its accessibility. The North Korean government has warned that anyone who tries to access it is subject to punishment.

In January 2007, YouTube was sued by Brazilian model and MTV VJ Daniella Cicarelli (the ex-fiancée of football player Ronaldo ) and her boyfriend due to the fact that the website hosted a video recorded by paparazzi in which she and her boyfriend were having sexual intercourse on a Spanish beach ; the video did not contain explicit content. The lawsuit asked that YouTube will be blocked in Brazil until all copies of the video were removed. On Saturday, January 6, 2007, a legal injunction ordered that filters be put in place to prevent users in Brazil from accessing the website.

The effectiveness of the measure was questioned, since the video was available not only on YouTube, but also on other sites as part of an Internet phenomenon . On Tuesday, January 9, 2007, the same court overturned its previous decision, allowing the filters to be removed. The video footage itself remained banned and was to be removed from the website.

In June 2007, a judge ordered Cicarelli and her boyfriend to pay all court and lawyer costs, as well as R$ 10,000 (roughly US$ 3,203) to the three defendants—YouTube, Globo , and iG , citing a lack of good faith in pushing the privacy case when their actions took place in public.

On November 30, 2017, most YouTube videos containing music seemed to be blocked by Finnish nonprofit performance rights organization Teosto in Finland.

The blocking of YouTube videos in Germany on copyright grounds was part of a dispute between YouTube and the Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte (Society for Musical Performing and Mechanical Reproduction Rights – GEMA ), a performance rights organization in Germany.

According to a German court in Hamburg, Google 's subsidiary YouTube can be held liable for damages when it hosts copyrighted videos without the copyright holder's permission. As a result, music videos for major label artists on YouTube, as well as many videos containing background music, were unavailable in Germany since the end of March 2009 after the previous agreement had expired and negotiations for a new license agreement were stopped. On October 31, 2016, YouTube and GEMA reached an agreement over royalties, ending a seven-year-long battle of blocking music videos in Germany.

On November 23, 2016, the German Kommission für Zulassung und Aufsicht (Commission for Authorization and Supervision), which is formed by representatives of German public broadcast stations, required PietSmiet & Co. , a German let's-player operating his own YouTube channel to get a German broadcast license by April 30, 2017, or else be regarded as an illegal pirate radio broadcaster for livestreaming , even when no radio spectrum use is included. Some YouTubers, even non profit, might fail at the expensive fee for applying a license. On April 30, 2017, the livestreaming channel PietSmietTV went offline. The channel PietSmiet remained online due not providing 24/7 streaming. The channel was mentioned in a requirement of a license.

The ban did not affect the other two ISPs in the country, Wana (now Inwi) and Méditel (now Orange Maroc).

However, the PTA's block inadvertently knocked out access to YouTube worldwide for two hours on February 25, 2008. Pakistan Telecom had broadcast to other ISPs in the Pacific Rim the false claim that it was the correct route for the addresses in YouTube's IP space. It was suggested by some Pakistani websites, blogs, and by electoral process watchdog groups at the time that the block was imposed largely to distract viewers from videos alleging vote-rigging by the ruling MQM party in the February 2008 general elections. Allegations of suppressing vote-rigging videos by the Musharraf administration were also leveled by Pakistani bloggers, newspapers, media, and Pakistani anti-Musharraf opposition parties.

On December 11, 2013, it was announced by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority that they had convinced Google's management to offer a local version of YouTube to Pakistan at youtube.com.pk, as it would be easy for the local authorities to remove "objectionable" material from a local version compared to the global version of YouTube. However, it would only be offered after the Pakistani government fulfilled some undisclosed requirements.

On April 21, 2014, Pakistan's Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights approved a resolution to lift the ban on YouTube.

In September 2021, YouTube blocked two German-language channels run by a Russian state-backed media company RT stating they spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines . In return, Roskomnadzor threatened to block the service in the country or fine Google unless the restrictions are lifted.
