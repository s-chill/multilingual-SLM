Percona XtraDB is a storage engine for the MariaDB and Percona Server databases, and is intended as a drop-in replacement to InnoDB , which is the default engine in MySQL .

Up until version 10.1, MariaDB used Percona XtraDB in place of InnoDB as the default storage engine. As of MariaDB 10.2, InnoDB is the default again.

XtraDB incorporates InnoDB's ACID-compliant design and MVCC architecture , and allows for a greater degree of tuning and scalability. The engine is also better suited to multi-core processing, which addresses some of the issues known to InnoDB.
