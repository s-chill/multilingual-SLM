Agritourism or agrotourism involves any agriculturally based operation or activity that brings visitors to a farm or ranch . It encompasses a wide range of activities, including direct-to-consumer sales such as farm stands and u-pick, agricultural education through school visits, hospitality services like overnight farm stays, recreational activities such as hunting and horseback riding, and entertainment events like hayrides and harvest dinners. These activities provide an additional source of income for farmers and help sustain small-scale farms.

Agritourism benefits surrounding communities by drawing tourists to rural areas, stimulating local economies, and fostering a greater appreciation for agricultural practices and local food systems. Many countries have embraced agritourism, implementing programs and initiatives to support and promote this sector.

A 2018 article published in the Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development classified agritourism activities as falling into one or more categories: direct-to-consumer sales (e.g., farm stands , u-pick ), agricultural education (e.g., schools visits to a farm), hospitality (overnight farm stays ), recreation (e.g., hunting, horseback riding ), and entertainment (e.g., hayrides , harvest dinners). Most agritourists spent time visiting farm stands, picking fruit, or feeding animals; others may navigate a corn maze or do a farm stay, assisting with chores or agricultural or ranch work.

Agricultural tourism has become a necessary means for many small farms’ survival. By diversifying business operations, farm operators are able to ensure a more stable income. This is because agritourism activities can occur during times of the year that crops may not be in season, and by providing a completely separate stream of income. Some studies have found that agritourism operations often benefit their surrounding communities by drawing tourists to the area. The economic boost by the increase in traffic can be beneficial to rural areas in need of diversified streams of income.

Since 1985 agritourism in Italy is formally regulated by a state law, amended in 2006.

Starting in 2013 Italy has used a sector trademark, “Agriturismo Italia”, accompanied by a new system of classification of farms with accommodation. The trademark, which distinguishes farms regularly operating in accordance with existing laws and regulations, shows a sunflower enclosing a farm. The classification (from 1 to 5 marks) represents the level of comfort, the variety of services and the quality of the natural environment that each farm is able to offer. This system was implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, in cooperation with all regional and national agritourism associations. The national system thus offers an overall guarantee which still takes account of specific regional characteristics.
