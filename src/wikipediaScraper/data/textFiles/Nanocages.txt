Gold Nanocages are hollow, porous gold nanoparticles ranging in size from 10 to over 150 nm.  They are created by reacting silver nanoparticles with chloroauric acid ( H Au Cl 4 ) in boiling water. Whereas gold nanoparticles absorb light in the visible spectrum of light (at about 550 nm), gold nanocages absorb light in the near-infrared , where biological tissues absorb the least light.  Because they are also biocompatible, gold nanocages are promising as a contrast agent for optical coherence tomography . Gold nanocages also absorb light and heat up ( Photothermal effect ), killing surrounding cancer cells .  Nanocages have been functionalized with cancer-specific antibodies .
