Sources of New Jersey utility-scale electricity generation: full-year 2023

This is a list of electricity-generating power stations in the U.S. state of New Jersey , sorted by type and name. In 2022, New Jersey had a total summer capacity of 16,712 MW through all of its power plants, and a net generation of 65,060 GWh. In 2023, the electrical energy generation mix was 51.4% natural gas, 44.1% nuclear, 2.5% solar, 1.1% biomass, 0.1% petroleum, 0.3% other gases, and 0.9% other.

New Jersey's renewable portfolio standard was updated in 2018 to require that 21% of electricity be from renewable sources by 2021, 35% by 2025, and 50% by 2030. In February 2023, Governor Phil Murphy set a goal of 100% clean electricity (including non-renewable zero-emissions sources) by 2035. About 75% of in-state renewable generation came from small- and large-scale solar photovoltaics (PV) that year. Small-scale solar, which includes customer-owned PV panels, delivered an additional net 3,413 GWh of energy to the state's electrical grid during 2023. This was more than twice the generation of New Jersey's utility-scale PV plants.
