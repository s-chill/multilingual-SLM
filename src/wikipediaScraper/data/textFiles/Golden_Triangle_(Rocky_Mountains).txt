The Golden Triangle is an informal designation for a region renowned as one of the premier fly fishing locations in the United States . The region is named for its approximate boundaries that form an equilateral triangle between Glacier National Park , Yellowstone National Park and Sun Valley, Idaho . Superior fly fishing also exists in the surrounding areas of the Rocky Mountains in Idaho , Montana , and Wyoming .

Because of a large number of major river systems such as the Yellowstone , Madison , Missouri , Snake , Salmon , and Clark Fork , many hundreds of fast, clear-running streams and high alpine lakes, the region contains a large number of trout .  Species such as brook , rainbow , brown , cutthroat , Bull trout , and golden trout are plentiful in this area, generally wild, and range in size from a few ounces to several pounds.
