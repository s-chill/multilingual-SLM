Old Perlican is a fishing village on the Avalon Peninsula , Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada . Incorporated in 1791, it is one of the oldest fishing communities in Newfoundland; it served as the major fishing station in Trinity Bay for migratory fisherman from England in the 17th century.

Its name was recorded as "Parlican" as early as 1597, with the "old" being added sometime later to distinguish it from New Perlican further up the bay.

It was settled by at least 1640. A "planter" (an early settler or colonist) named John Barrett (1654-1714) lived there after arriving from Poole, England in 1711. One of, if not, the oldest recorded English land transaction in Newfoundland archives is between John Barrett and John Carter in 1711 in Old Perlican. The original is in the St. John's archives and a photocopy hangs in the Old Perlican Town Hall.

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada , Old Perlican had a population of 608 living in 253 of its 316 total private dwellings, a change of -3.9% from its 2016 population of 633 . With a land area of 14.14 km (5.46 sq mi), it had a population density of 43.0/km (111.4/sq mi) in 2021.
