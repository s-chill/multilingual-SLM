Akwidaa is a small town and fishing village in Ahanta West district , Western Region of Ghana . It is one of the southernmost places in Ghana.

The part of town near the Gulf of Guinea , known as Akiwidaa Old Town, suffers from flooding and erosion as a result of climate change . This is due to its location in a low-lying area adjacent to a wetland and river mouth. This resulted in most of the residents evacuating inland, which would become Akiwidaa New Town.

Akwidaa is a Twi word meaning 'old man'. It is believe to be named after a man who transported people over the Ezile River during Dutch colonial times . The town was originally named after the river.

The town have been settled for centuries by the Ahanta people .

In the late 17th and early 18th Century, Akwidaa, then known as Fort Dorothea, was the smaller of the two forts which constituted a German colony, the Brandenburger Gold Coast . After being captured by the Dutch, they occupied the fort from 1687 to 1698 from whom the Brandenburgers sold it in 1718. The ruins of the fort were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979 along with other forts in the region.
