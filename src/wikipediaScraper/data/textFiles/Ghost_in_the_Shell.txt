Ghost in the Shell is a Japanese cyberpunk media franchise based on the seinen manga series of the same name written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow . The manga, first serialized in 1989 under the subtitle of The Ghost in the Shell , and later published as its own tankōbon volumes by Kodansha , told the story of the fictional counter-cyberterrorist organization Public Security Section 9 , led by protagonist Major Motoko Kusanagi , and is set in mid-21st century Japan.

Animation studio Production I.G has produced several anime adaptations of the series. These include the 1995 film of the same name and its 2004 sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence ; the 2002 television series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex , and its 2020 follow-up, Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045 ; and the Ghost in the Shell: Arise original video animation (OVA) series. In addition, an American-produced live-action film was released on March 31, 2017.

The original editor Koichi Yuri says: At first, Ghost in the Shell came from Shirow, but when Yuri asked "something more flashy", Shirow came up with "攻殻機動隊 Koukaku Kidou Tai (Shell Squad) " for Yuri. But Shirow was attached to including "Ghost in the Shell" as well even if in smaller type.

Primarily set in the mid-twenty-first century in the fictional Japanese city of Niihama, Niihama Prefecture ( 新浜県新浜市 , Niihama-ken Niihama-shi ) , otherwise known as New Port City ( ニューポートシティ , Nyū Pōto Shiti ) , the manga and the many anime adaptations follow the members of Public Security Section 9 , a task-force consisting of various professionals skilled at solving and preventing crime, mostly with some sort of police background. Political intrigue and counter-terrorism operations are standard fare for Section 9, but the various actions of corrupt officials, companies, and cyber-criminals in each scenario are unique and require the diverse skills of Section 9's staff to prevent a series of incidents from escalating.

In this post-cyberpunk iteration of a possible future, computer technology has advanced to the point that many members of the public possess cyberbrains, technology that allows them to interface their biological brain with various networks. The level of cyberization varies from simple minimal interfaces to almost complete replacement of the brain with cybernetic parts, in cases of severe trauma. This can also be combined with various levels of prostheses , with a fully prosthetic body enabling a person to become a cyborg . The main character of Ghost in the Shell , Major Motoko Kusanagi , is such a cyborg, having had a terrible accident befall her as a child that ultimately required her to use a full-body prosthesis to house her cyberbrain. This high level of cyberization, however, opens the brain up to attacks from highly skilled hackers, with the most dangerous being those who will hack a person to bend to their whims.

The original Ghost in the Shell manga ran in Japan from April 1989 to November 1990 in Kodansha 's manga anthology Young Magazine , and was released in a tankōbon volume on October 2, 1991.

Ghost in the Shell influenced some prominent filmmakers. The Wachowskis , creators of The Matrix and its sequels, showed it to producer Joel Silver , saying, "We wanna do that for real." The Matrix series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain , which was inspired by the opening credits of Ghost in the Shell , and the way characters access the Matrix through holes in the back of their necks. Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron 's Avatar , Steven Spielberg 's A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Jonathan Mostow 's Surrogates . James Cameron cited Ghost in the Shell as a source of inspiration, citing it as an influence on Avatar .

Bungie 's 2001 third-person action game Oni draws substantial inspiration from Ghost in the Shell 's setting and characters. Ghost in the Shell also influenced video games such as the Metal Gear Solid series, Deus Ex , and Cyberpunk 2077 .
