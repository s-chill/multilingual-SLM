Since July 2013 the service has been called IaaS Trusted Public S5 .

Fujitsu produces the SPARC -compliant CPU ( SPARClite ), the "Venus" 128 GFLOP SPARC64 VIIIfx model is included in the K computer , the world's fastest supercomputer in June 2011 with a rating of over 8 petaflops, and in October 2011, K became the first computer to top 10 petaflops. This speed was achieved in testing on October 7–8, and the results were then presented at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC11) in November 2011.

The Fujitsu FR , FR-V and ARM architecture microprocessors are widely used, additionally in ASICs and Application-specific standard products (ASSP) like the Milbeaut with customer variants named Nikon Expeed . They were acquired by Spansion in 2013.

The old slogan "The possibilities are infinite" can be found below the company's logo on major advertisements and ties in with the small logo above the letters J and I of the word Fujitsu. This smaller logo represents the symbol for infinity .

The new slogan is "shaping tomorrow with you".

Fujitsu designed, developed and operated the Horizon IT system which was at the centre of the legal dispute between the UK Post Office and its sub-postmasters. The case, still unsettled, found that the IT system was unreliable and that faults in the system caused discrepancies in branch accounts which were not the responsibility of the postmasters themselves. Mr Justice Fraser , the judge hearing the case, noted that Fujitsu had given "wholly unsatisfactory evidence" and there had been a "lack of accuracy on the part of Fujitsu witnesses in their evidence". Following his concerns, Fraser sent a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions .

Fujitsu was also found to have pressurised the UK government to sign off the controversial and faulty IT system that, as a result of its faulty operation, resulted in numerous UK postmasters and sub-postmasters being accused falsely, and subsequently convicted of theft, false accounting and fraud, with consequences including imprisonment and monetary reparations. Of the hundreds of people affected, as of January 2024 only around 1 in 9 of those convicted have had their convictions overturned, whereas others have died due to the length of time that has elapsed, or have taken their own lives in the wake of their wrongful convictions. Although there has been some media coverage of organised legal appeals by groups of those affected, the matter has recently gained enhanced attention by mainstream media and the wider public as a whole, and is currently being acted upon by authorities in an attempt to accelerate and automate the clearing of the names of all those wrongly convicted, who until now were required to launch their own legal appeals in order to have their names cleared.

Fujitsu reports that all its notebook and tablet PCs released globally comply with the latest Energy Star standard.

Greenpeace 's Cool IT Leaderboard of April 2013 "examines how IT companies use their considerable influence to change government policies that will drive clean energy deployment" and ranks Fujitsu 4th out of 21 leading manufacturers, on the strength of "developed case study data of its solutions with fairly transparent methodology, and is the leading company in terms of establishing ambitious and detailed goals for future carbon savings from its IT solutions."
