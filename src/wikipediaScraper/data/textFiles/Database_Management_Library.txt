Database Management Library ( DBL ) is a relational database management system (RDBMS) contained in a C++ programming library . The DBL source code is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License .

DBL was fully developed within two weeks, as a holiday programming project.

It aims to be easy and simple to use for C++ programming.

DBL is a library and  becomes an integral part of the application program. Unlike clientâ€“server model database management systems that are standalone process with which the application program communicates. The application software uses DBL's functionality through function calls .

This is a basic program that creates a simple database. However, as this task must be done usually once, it can be done by the DBL command-line interface .

This class stores the database name and its tables.
The main functions are:

Useful functions that use the class database are:

This class stores the table name and its structure, the columns of the table.
The main functions are:

Useful functions that use the class table are:

This class stores the columns of the table and the data to be stored in the data file.
The main functions are:

Useful functions that use the class row are:

This class stores the column and a value for that column.
The main functions are:

Useful functions that use the class storage are:

This class stores the name and the structure of a column.
The main functions are:

This class stores the indexes of a table.
The main functions are:

Useful functions that use the class index are:

By the DBL command-line interface program one can create a database, a table, and add columns to this table, besides other operations such as printing.
