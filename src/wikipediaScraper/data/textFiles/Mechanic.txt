A mechanic is a skilled tradesperson who uses tools to build, maintain, or repair machinery , especially cars.

Most mechanics specialize in a particular field, such as auto body mechanics, diesel mechanics, air conditioning and refrigeration mechanics, auto mechanics , bicycle mechanics , boiler mechanics, race car mechanics, aircraft mechanics, and other areas. There are also mobile mechanics who work on heavy equipment that will come to you if there is an issue that must be resolved at the location of the machine.

A mechanic is typically certified by a trade association or regional government power. Mechanics may be separated into two classes based on the type of machines they work on, heavyweight and lightweight. Heavyweight work is on larger machines or heavy equipment , such as tractors, construction equipment, and trailers, while lightweight work is on smaller items, such as automobiles.

Automotive mechanics have many trades within. Some may specialize in the electrical diagnosis, while others may specialize in the mechanical aspects. Other mechanical areas include: brakes and steering , suspension, automatic or manual transmission , engine repairs, auto body repairs, or diagnosing customer complaints.

Automotive mechanics require many years of training to become licensed. Countries like Canada have a governmental certification body that tests and maintains automotive mechanics' qualifications. The United States of America uses an organization that is called ASE. This organization provides independent testing of an automotive mechanic's skills with over 57 different tests that can be taken.
