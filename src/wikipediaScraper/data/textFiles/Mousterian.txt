The Mousterian (or Mode III ) is an archaeological industry of stone tools , associated primarily with the Neanderthals in Europe , and to the earliest anatomically modern humans in North Africa and West Asia . The Mousterian largely defines the latter part of the Middle Paleolithic , the middle of the West Eurasian Old Stone Age . It lasted roughly from 160,000 to 40,000 BP . If its predecessor, known as Levallois or Levallois-Mousterian, is included, the range is extended to as early as c. 300,000–200,000 BP. The main following period is the Aurignacian (c. 43,000–28,000 BP) of Homo sapiens .

The culture was named after the type site of Le Moustier , three superimposed rock shelters in the Dordogne region of France. Similar flintwork has been found all over unglaciated Europe and also the Near East and North Africa . Handaxes , racloirs , and points constitute the industry; sometimes a Levallois technique or another prepared-core technique was employed in making the flint flakes.

The European Mousterian is the product of Neanderthals . It existed roughly from 160,000 to 40,000 BP . Some assemblages, namely those from Pech de l'Aze, include exceptionally small points prepared using the Levallois technique among other prepared core types, causing some researchers to suggest that these flakes take advantage of greater grip strength possessed by Neanderthals.

In North Africa and the Near East, Mousterian tools were produced by anatomically modern humans . In the Eastern Mediterranean , for example, assemblages produced by Neanderthals are indistinguishable from those made by Qafzeh type modern humans. The Mousterian industry in North Africa is estimated to be 315,000 years old.

Possible variants are Denticulate, Charentian (Ferrassie & Quina) named after the Charente region, Typical, and the Mousterian Traditional Acheulian (MTA) Type-A and Type-B. The industry continued alongside the new Châtelperronian industry during the 45,000–40,000 BP period.
