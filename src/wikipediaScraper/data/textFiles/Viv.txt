Viv is a discontinued intelligent personal assistant created by the developers of Siri .

It debuted on May 9, 2016, at TechCrunch Disrupt New York . Compared to Siri, the software's platform is open and can accommodate external plug-ins written to work with the assistant. It can also handle more complex queries. The development team has been working on the software since 2012 and had raised over $22 million in funding by early 2015 and $30 million by early 2016.

On October 5, 2016, the software and its developer, Viv Labs, Inc. (formerly Six Five Labs, Inc.) was acquired by Samsung Electronics .

The following month, it was revealed that a personal assistant software would be available on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ . This, however, turned out to be Bixby , which was a relaunch of S Voice , rather than based on Viv. In October 2017, Samsung announced Viv Labs technology would be integrated into Bixby 2.0.
