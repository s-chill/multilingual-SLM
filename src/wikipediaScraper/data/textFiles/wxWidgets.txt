wxWidgets (formerly wxWindows ) is a widget toolkit and tools library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for cross-platform applications. wxWidgets enables a program's GUI code to compile and run on several computer platforms with no significant code changes. A wide choice of compilers and other tools to use with wxWidgets facilitates development of sophisticated applications. wxWidgets supports a comprehensive range of popular operating systems and graphical libraries, both proprietary and free .

The project was started under the name wxWindows in 1992 by Julian Smart at the University of Edinburgh . The project was renamed wxWidgets in 2004 in response to a trademark claim by Microsoft UK .

It is free and open source software , distributed under the terms of the wxWidgets Licence , which satisfies those who wish to produce for GPL and proprietary software .

wxWidgets covers systems such as Microsoft Windows , Mac OS ( Carbon and Cocoa ), iOS ( Cocoa Touch ), Linux / Unix ( X11 , Motif , and GTK ), OpenVMS , OS/2 and AmigaOS . A version for embedded systems is under development.

wxWidgets is used across various industry sectors, most notably by Xerox , Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Lockheed Martin , NASA and the Center for Naval Analyses . It is also used in the public sector and education by, for example, Dartmouth Medical School , National Human Genome Research Institute , National Center for Biotechnology Information , and many others. wxWidgets is used in many open source projects, and by individual developers.

wxWidgets (initially wxWindows; "w" is for Windows , and "x" is for X Window System ) was started in 1992 by Julian Smart at the University of Edinburgh . He attained an honours degree in Computational science from the University of St Andrews in 1986, and is still a core developer.

On 20 February 2004, the developers of wxWindows announced that the project was changing its name to wxWidgets , as a result of Microsoft requesting Julian Smart to respect Microsoft's United Kingdom trademark of the term Windows .

Major release versions were 2.4 on 6 January 2003, 2.6 on 21 April 2005 and 2.8.0 on 14 December 2006. Version 3.0 was released on 11 November 2013.

wxWidgets has participated in the Google Summer of Code since 2006.

wxWidgets is distributed under a custom made wxWindows Licence , similar to the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), with an exception stating that derived works in binary form may be distributed on the user's own terms. This license is a free software license approved by the FSF, making wxWidgets free software . It has been approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).

wxWidgets is supported on the following platforms:

wxWidgets is officially confirmed to work properly with the following compilers:

The wxWidgets library is implemented in C++ , with bindings available for many commonly used programming languages .

wxWidgets is best described as a native mode toolkit as it provides a thin abstraction to a platform's native widgets, contrary to emulating the display of widgets using graphic primitives. Calling a native widget on the target platform results in a more native looking interface than toolkits such as Swing (for Java), as well as offering performance and other benefits.

The toolkit is also not restricted to GUI development, having an inter-process communication layer, socket networking functionality, and more.

There are many Rapid Application Development (RAD) and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools available. Notable tools include:
