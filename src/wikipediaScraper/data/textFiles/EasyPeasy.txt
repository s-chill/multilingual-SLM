EasyPeasy (formerly named Ubuntu Eee ) was a Linux-based operating system for netbooks . EasyPeasy was built upon Debian and Ubuntu , but was customized for low-powered computers and access to web applications . EasyPeasy is maintained as an open source project, though it primarily uses popular web applications or proprietary software over free and open source software alternatives (e.g. Skype over Ekiga ) when the functionality offered is deemed better by its users.

Ubuntu Eee was started by Jon Ramvi in December 2007. At that time it was only some scripts which modified a regular Ubuntu installation to support the Asus Eee PCs . In June 2008 the project was disbanded as a script and Ubuntu Eee 8.04 was released as a stand-alone distribution , based on Ubuntu 8.04 with EeePC support installed out of the box. On September 5 followed the 8.04.1 version. It used a new Linux kernel, came with a new user interface and Flash 10.

It was renamed EasyPeasy in January 2009, and has been downloaded well over a million times from the main mirror.

On September 10, 2008, Canonical notified Jon Ramvi by email that the project's use of Canonical's names, URLs, and logos violated Canonical's trademarks in the original name Ubuntu Eee . In response, the owners of the project announced that they would use a new name EasyPeasy and version 1.0 was released January 1, 2009.
