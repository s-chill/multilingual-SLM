SPL ( Sentence Plan Language ) is an abstract notation representing the semantics of a sentence in natural language . In a classical Natural Language Generation (NLG) workflow, an initial text plan (hierarchically or sequentially organized factoids, often modelled in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory ) is transformed by a sentence planner (generator) component to a sequence of sentence plans modelled in a Sentence Plan Language. A surface generator can be used to transform the SPL notation into natural language sentences.

Probably the most widely used SPL language used today (2022) is AMR ( Abstract Meaning Representation , see there for further references), but is owes parts of its popularity to its application to NLP problems other than NLG, e.g., machine translation and semantic parsing.
