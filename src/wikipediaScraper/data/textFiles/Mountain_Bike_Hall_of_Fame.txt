The Mountain Bike Hall of Fame ( MBHOF ) was founded in 1988 to chronicle the history of mountain biking . Formerly located in Crested Butte , Colorado , it relocated to Fairfax, California in 2014 and became part of the Marin Museum of Bicycling .

Since the creation of this sport in the 1970s, mountain biking has grown to be immensely popular worldwide and the MBHOF works to document individuals and events which have significantly contributed to mountain biking history. The museum houses items of memorabilia, vintage bikes and components, classic photos, press clippings, and highlights from historic races and events. As of 2016, the MBHOF has inducted more than 140 individuals and groups who have made major contributions to mountain biking.
