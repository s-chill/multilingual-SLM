iOS is a mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. and was first released as iPhone OS in June 2007, coinciding with the launch of the first generation iPhone . iPhone OS was renamed iOS following the release of the iPad , starting with iOS 4 . With iOS 13, Apple began offering a separate operating system, iPadOS , for the iPad. iOS is also the foundation of the newer audioOS and tvOS , and shares some of its code with macOS . New iOS versions are released yearly, alongside new iPhone models . From the launch of the iPhone in 2007 until the launch of iPhone 4 in 2010, this occurred in June or July; since then, new major versions are usually released in September, with the exception of iOS 5 , which released in October 2011. Since the launch of the iPhone in June 2007, there have been 18 major releases of iOS, with the current major version being iOS 18 , released on September 16, 2024.

iPhone OS 1 was announced by Apple at the iPhone announcement keynote on January 9, 2007. It was later released alongside the original iPhone that same year on June 29. No official name for the operating system was given when the iPhone was released, and Steve Jobs just said "iPhone runs OS X ", however it was later referred to as iPhone Software . During the development phase of iPhone OS 1, "probably 16, 17 different concepts" were developed. Many on the team were skeptical of the feasibility of a touchscreen keyboard, and believed that users would prefer hardware keyboards. A number of different user interfaces were prototyped, including one that involved a multi-touch click-wheel.

iPhone OS 1 laid the groundwork of the iPhone's operating system, including a grid-based Home Screen called SpringBoard , and a set of 16 built-in applications, including an application called Text for sending Short Message Service (SMS) messages, a YouTube application for watching videos hosted on the platform, as well as a Maps application built around Google Maps that featured support for route directions, traffic conditions (in supported regions), and support for finding and contacting businesses. It also featured a version of Safari , the web browser from Mac OS X , built around the mobile touchscreen interface of the iPhone. Other applications included iPod, for listening to music synced to the given iPhone; Mail, for composing, viewing, and receiving emails ; Phone, for taking or making calls, viewing or adding contacts, and listening to voicemails; and Settings, for customizing the behavior of the iPhone as well as its built-in applications. Support for multi-touch gestures, such as pinch-to-zoom, double tap, and scrolling via flicking and dragging was also included. However, the operating system was criticized for not supporting content made with Adobe Flash , lacking support for cut, copy and paste features, as well as its lack of support for Bluetooth stereo headphones. It also lacked support for third-party native apps, and only supported web apps, which was criticized by reviewers and developers, including John Carmack .

The first version of operating system received one major update, iPhone OS 1.1, which added support for the first generation iPod Touch , as well as a mobile version of the iTunes Music Store . iPhone OS 1.1.4 is the final version of iPhone OS 1 for the first generation iPhone, with iPhone OS 1.1.5 being the final version of iPhone OS 1 available for the first generation iPod Touch. It was succeeded by iPhone OS 2 on July 11, 2008.

Apple announced iPhone OS 2 at a keynote on March 6, 2008, and it was released to the public on July 11, 2008, alongside the iPhone 3G . iPhone OS 2 was the first release to have the App Store and to come with an official software development kit (SDK), allowing third-party developers to create native appications for the iPhone and therefore the operating system. It also added many enterprise features, including Microsoft Exchange support through ActiveSync for push emails, push contact and push calendars, and support for IPsec VPNs. Apple did not drop support for any devices that ran iPhone OS 1 with this release.
