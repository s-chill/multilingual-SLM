Wind power is a growing source of electricity in Poland . In 2019, wind was the second most important source of electricity produced in Poland, after coal, accounting for about 10% of the electricity production.

From 2012 to 2014 the Nowy Tomyśl Wind Turbines were the tallest wind turbines in the world with a pinnacle height of 210 metres (690 ft). They are still the tallest wind turbines installed on lattice towers.

In May 2018 state-owned PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna decided to invest in offshore wind power pending delayed negotiations on building nuclear power plants in Poland . They aim to build 2.5 GW by 2030.

The total wind power grid-connected capacity in Poland was 9,428.3 MW as of 31 December 2023. In September 2020, the government announced a 130 billion zloty (£26.5 billion) plan to invest in offshore wind . According to Poland's Supreme Audit Office , the Polish areas of the Baltic Sea could generate up to 28 GW in offshore wind power. The Polish government's energy development plan aims for an installation of 5.9GW of offshore wind power by 2030 and 11GW by 2040. A 1.5 GW offshore wind farm is currently being built near Słupsk .

As of the end of 2015, total installed capacity was 5.1 gigawatts (GW), which provided 10,858 gigawatt-hours (GW·h) — around 6.22% of the electricity consumed in the country. By year end 2016 total installed capacity had risen to 5,782 MW.

Energy production sources are also registered by the state Energy Regulatory Office (URE).

Some of the points of production are:
