The FISH (FIbonacci SHrinking) stream cipher is a fast software based stream cipher using Lagged Fibonacci generators , plus a concept from the shrinking generator cipher. It was published by Siemens in 1993. FISH is quite fast in software and has a huge key length . However, in the same paper where he proposed Pike , Ross Anderson showed that FISH can be broken with just a few thousand bits of known plaintext .
