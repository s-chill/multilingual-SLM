In computer science , a stream is a sequence of potentially unlimited data elements made available over time. A stream can be thought of as items on a conveyor belt being processed one at a time rather than in large batches. Streams are processed differently from batch data .

Normal functions cannot operate on streams as a whole because they have potentially unlimited data. Formally, streams are codata (potentially unlimited), not data (which is finite).

Functions that operate on a stream producing another stream are known as filters and can be connected in pipelines in a manner analogous to function composition . Filters may operate on one item of a stream at a time or may base an item of output on multiple items of input such as a moving average .

The term "stream" is used in a number of similar ways:

Streams can be used as the underlying data type for channels in interprocess communication .

The term "stream" is also applied to file system forks , where multiple sets of data are associated with a single filename. Most often, there is one main stream that makes up the normal file data, while additional streams contain metadata . Here "stream" is used to indicate "variable size data", as opposed to fixed size metadata such as extended attributes , but differs from "stream" as used otherwise, meaning "data available over time, potentially infinite".
