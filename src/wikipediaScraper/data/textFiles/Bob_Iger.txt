Robert Alan Iger was born to a Jewish family in New York City. He is the oldest son of Miriam "Mimi" (née Tunick) (1927–2013) and Arthur L. Iger (1926–2010). His father was a World War II Navy veteran who was the executive vice president and general manager of the Greenvale Marketing Corporation, and was also a professor of advertising and public relations. His mother worked at Boardman Junior High School in Oceanside, New York . Arthur's father Joe (i.e. Bob's paternal grandfather) was cartoonist Jerry Iger 's brother.

He was raised in Oceanside, where he attended the Fulton Avenue School and graduated from Oceanside High School in 1969. In 1973, he graduated magna cum laude from the School of Communications at Ithaca College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television and Radio.

Iger began his media career in 1972 as the host of Campus Probe , an Ithaca College television show. He dreamed of becoming a news anchor while he worked as a weatherman in Ithaca for five months, before shifting his career goals.

In 1974, Iger joined the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). His first job was performing menial labor on television sets for $150 a week (over $700, adjusted for inflation).

In 1988, Iger was the senior program executive for the Calgary Winter Olympics . The event was marred by disruptive weather and delayed events, and to fill the broadcast schedule Iger's team focused on human interest stories such as those of the Jamaican bobsled team and Eddie the Eagle . The event achieved record-high ratings for ABC, and Iger's performance under pressure caught the attention of ABC executives Daniel Burke and Thomas Murphy , who subsequently championed Iger throughout his ascent at ABC.

In 1989, he was named head of ABC Entertainment , green lighting shows such as Twin Peaks , America's Funniest Home Videos and Cop Rock . He was president of the ABC Network Television Group from January 1993 to 1994, and was appointed as Capital Cities/ABC senior vice president in March 1993 and executive vice president in July 1993. In 1994, Iger was named president and chief operating officer of ABC's corporate parent, Capital Cities/ABC.

In 1995, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC and renamed it ABC, Inc. , where Iger remained chairman until 1999.

On February 25, 1999, Disney named Iger the president of Walt Disney International, the business unit that oversees Disney's international operations, as well as chairman of the ABC Group, removing him from day-to-day authority at ABC. Disney called the change a promotion for Iger.

Disney named Iger the president and chief operating officer (COO) on January 24, 2000, making him Disney's No. 2 executive under chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner . Disney had been without a separate president since Eisner assumed the role following the departure of Michael Ovitz in 1997, after sixteen months at Disney.

In 2003, board members Roy E. Disney and Stanley Gold began a campaign called "save Disney" against Eisner. As a result, Disney began a search for the next CEO to replace Eisner. On March 13, 2005, Disney announced that Iger would succeed Michael Eisner as CEO, and Iger was placed in charge of day-to-day operations, though Eisner held the title of CEO until he resigned on September 30, 2005. In July 2005, Disney and Gold dropped the campaign and agreed to work with Iger.

One of Iger's first major decisions as CEO was to reassign Disney's chief strategic officer, Peter Murphy , and disband the company's Strategic Planning division. It was around this time Iger started to become known as "Bob" rather than "Robert".

On January 24, 2006, under Iger's leadership, Disney announced it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock transaction. In the same year, Iger also re-acquired the rights to Walt Disney 's first star, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , from NBCUniversal by releasing sportscaster Al Michaels from ABC Sports to NBC Sports .

Iger's contract as Disney's chairman and CEO was originally planned to run until June 30, 2018. In March 2017, Disney extended Iger's term to July 2, 2019, and said he would be a consultant for the following three years. In December 2017, Disney extended Iger's contract through 2021.

In 2020, Iger announced his intention to retire. On February 25 that year, the board of directors named Bob Chapek – then-chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products – the new chief executive, while appointing Iger executive chairman (an ad hoc post) to oversee the transition. In April however, the board unexpectedly extended Iger's mandate until the end of 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic . On December 31, 2021, Iger stepped down and was succeeded by Susan Arnold as chair of the board. However, on November 20, 2022, Chapek was ousted by the Disney board with Iger reinstated as CEO. At the time of his rejoining Disney, Iger initially agreed to hold the post for two years while looking for a successor. However, on July 12, 2023, Iger and Disney extended the contract until the end of 2026.

On November 15, 2011, Apple Inc. , led by CEO Tim Cook , named Iger to its board of directors. Iger was reportedly responsible for making Steve Jobs Disney's largest shareholder after its all-stock acquisition of Jobs' Pixar.

In November 2017, Variety reported that Iger knew about a 2010 Oscar party where Pixar chief John Lasseter was seen "making out with a junior staffer", seeming to confirm anonymous allegations that Lasseter's inappropriate interactions with young women had been known to company leadership since the 1990s. One anonymous source was quoted as saying, "I know personally that Bob was aware. ... Everybody was aware. They just didn't do anything about it."

In August 2019, Vanity Fair reported that actress Paz de la Huerta added Iger to her lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein over allegations of rape, claiming that he and previous CEO Michael Eisner "made a series of decisions that allowed a range of actions by Harvey Weinstein that unacceptably harmed certain employees".
