The cartography of Israel is the history of mapping and map creation of modern Israel as well as the historic Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) and Land of Israel .

Prior to the declaration of Israel in 1948, the UN proposed a United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine based on the location of land legally purchased and used to create Jewish Settlements in the area.

In October 2023, internet users noticed "the name Israel no longer appears on leading local digital maps services such as Baidu or Alibaba". Sources report that major cities are still defined as well as the borders that define present-day Israel and Palestinian territories, but not the name itself. WION (World Is One News) reported that it is because 'Chinese internet is getting inundated with antisemitism following the Israel-Hamas war'.
