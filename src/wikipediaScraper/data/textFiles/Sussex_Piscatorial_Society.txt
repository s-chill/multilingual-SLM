Sussex Piscatorial Society (SPS) is a fishing club with waters in East and West Sussex and surrounding counties.  SPS was founded in 1891, and separate Coarse and Trout Sections were created in 1923.

Rudyard Kipling , author of The Jungle Book , was a member.

In 2007 SPS won recognition from the Wild Trout Trust for conservation work on their stretch of the River Itchen .
