A Master of Science in Engineering ( MSE ) or Master of Engineering Science is an academic graduate degree awarded by universities in many countries. It is differentiated from a Master of Engineering (a professional degree ).

A MSE can require completion of a thesis and qualifies the holder to apply for a program leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (often abbreviated PhD or DPhil) in engineering, while a Master of Engineering can require completion of a project rather than thesis and usually does not qualify its holder to apply for a PhD or DPhil in engineering science.

The MSE is considered equivalent to diplom degree in engineering in the countries that do not have a specific distinction between MSE and Master of Engineering.
