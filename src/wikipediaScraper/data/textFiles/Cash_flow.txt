Cash flow , in general, refers to payments made into or out of a business, project, or financial product. It can also refer more specifically to a real or virtual movement of money .

Cash flows are narrowly interconnected with the concepts of value , interest rate, and liquidity . A cash flow that shall happen on a future day t N can be transformed into a cash flow of the same value in t 0 .

The sum of the three component above will be the cash flow for a project.

And the cash flow for a company also include three parts:

The sum of the three components above will be the total cash flow of a company.

The net cash flow only provides a limited amount of information. Compare, for instance, the cash flows over three years of two companies:
