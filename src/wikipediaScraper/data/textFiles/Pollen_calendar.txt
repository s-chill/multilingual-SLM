A pollen calendar is used to show the peak pollen times for different types of plant pollen, which causes allergic reactions in certain people.

A pollen calendar can be a very useful tool in forensic science , because it can be used to place the month, or week, or date of death . The use of pollen for criminal investigation purposes is called "forensic palynology ".

However, the use of a pollen calendar to set the date of death should be used with extreme caution, and only by a carefully trained expert witness . The CSI effect has put pressure on some police officers and district attorneys to provide pollen-based evidence , but such evidence "appear[s] to be of limited use in the forensic context where outcomes are scrutinised in court ."
