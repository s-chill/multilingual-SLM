A bush airplane is a general aviation aircraft used to provide both scheduled and unscheduled passenger and flight services to remote, undeveloped areas, such as the Canadian north or bush , Alaskan tundra , the African bush, or savanna , Amazon rainforest and the Australian Outback . They are used where ground transportation infrastructure is inadequate or does not exist.

A bush plane is defined by how it is used, and many different aircraft with different configurations have been so used over the years. However, experience has shown certain traits to be desirable (though not mandatory), especially on aircraft specifically designed as bush planes.
