The SnakeBot , also known as a snake robot, is a biomorphic, hyper-redundant robot that resembles a snake . Snake robots come in many shapes and sizes, from as long as four stories ( earthquake SnakeBot developed by SINTEF ) to a medical SnakeBot developed at Carnegie Mellon University able to maneuver around organs inside a human chest cavity. SnakeBots share similar uses to certain types of soft robots .

SnakeBots can vary greatly in size and design. Small cross-section-to-length ratios allow them to maneuver through tight spaces. Their ability to change shape allows them to traverse varied terrain.

Many snake robots are constructed by chaining together several independent links. This redundancy allows them to continue operating even after parts of their body are destroyed. Properties such as high terrainability , redundancy, and the ability to completely seal their bodies make snake robots notable for practical applications and as a research topic.

A SnakeBot differs from a snake-arm robot in that SnakeBots are usually self-contained, whereas snake-arm robots usually have remote mechanicals from the arm itself, possibly connected to a larger system.

SnakeBots are being developed to assist search and rescue , inspection of tubes and bridges , due to their ability to reach tight spaces that humans cannot, such as environments cluttered with rubble.

While SnakeBots mimic the slithering strategy of snakes , other rescue robots, such as the Deep Robotics X20, pursue strategies based on quadrupedalism . These strategies provide trade-offs in different terrains.

Traditional SnakeBots move by changing the shape of their body, similar to actual snakes. Many variants have been created which use wheels or treads for movement. No SnakeBots have yet been developed that match the locomotion of snakes, however, researchers have been able to produce new ways of moving that do not occur in nature. .

In SnakeBot research, a gait is a periodic mode of locomotion. For example, sidewinding and lateral undulation are both gaits. SnakeBot gaits are often designed by investigating period changes to the shape of the robot. For example, a caterpillar moves by changing the shape of its body to match a sinusoidal wave . Similarly, a SnakeBot can move by adapting its shape to different periodic functions. .

Sidewinder rattlesnakes can ascend sandy slopes by increasing the portion of their bodies in contact with the sand to match the reduced yielding force of the inclined sand, allowing them to ascend the maximum possible sand slope without slip. SnakeBots that side-wind can replicate this ascent.

SnakeBots are currently being researched as a new type of robotic , interplanetary probe by engineers at the NASA Ames Research Center . Software for SnakeBot is also being developed by NASA , so that they can learn by experiencing the skills to scale obstacles and remember the techniques.

Snake robots are also being developed for search and rescue purposes at Carnegie Mellon University 's Biorobotics Lab.
