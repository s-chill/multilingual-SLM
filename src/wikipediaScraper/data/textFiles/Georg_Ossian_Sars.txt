Prof Georg Ossian Sars H FRSE (20 April 1837 â€“ 9 April 1927) was a Norwegian marine and freshwater biologist .

Georg Ossian Sars was born on 20 April 1837 in Kinn, Norway (now part of Flora ), the son of Pastor Michael Sars and Maren Sars ; the historian Ernst Sars was his elder brother, and the singer and women's skiing pioneer Eva Nansen was his younger sister. He grew up in Manger , Hordaland , where his father was the local priest. He studied from 1852 to 1854 at Bergen Cathedral School , from 1854 at Christiania Cathedral School , and joined the university at Christiana (now the University of Oslo ) in 1857. He indulged his interest in natural history while studying medicine; having collected water fleas in local lakes with Wilhelm Lilljeborg 's works, he discovered new species, and this resulted in his first scientific publication. Georg Ossian Sars had a good memory and excellent drawing skills, and illustrated some of his father's zoological works.

Sars was a founding investigator of ichthyoplankton . In 1864, he was commissioned by the Norwegian government to investigate fisheries around the Norwegian coast. One of his first discoveries was that the eggs of cod are pelagic , that is, they inhabit the open water column . He continued to receive the patronage of the government throughout his career. Sars' primary research focus was on crustaceans and their systematics . He described many new species in his career, including in his magnum opus , An Account of the Crustacea of Norway .

For his achievements, Sars was made a Knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1892, and elevated to Knight-Commander in 1911. He was further awarded the Linnean Medal in 1910.

Georg Ossian Sars never married, and died on 9 April 1927 in Oslo . He is remembered in the scientific names of a number of marine invertebrates , as well as the journal Sarsia , the Sars International Centre for Marine Molecular Biology and the flagship of the Norwegian research fleet , the RV G.O.Sars .
