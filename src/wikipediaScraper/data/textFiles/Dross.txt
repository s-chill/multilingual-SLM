Dross is a mass of solid impurities floating on a molten metal or dispersed in the metal, such as in wrought iron. It forms on the surface of low- melting-point metals such as tin , lead , zinc or aluminium or alloys by oxidation of the metal. For higher melting point metals and alloys such as steel and silver , oxidized impurities melt and float making them easy to pour off.

With wrought iron , hammering and later rolling remove some dross. With tin and lead the dross can be removed by adding sodium hydroxide pellets, which dissolve the oxides and form a slag . If floating, dross can also be skimmed off.

Dross, as a solid, is distinguished from slag , which is a liquid. Dross product is not entirely waste material; for example, aluminium dross can be recycled and is also used in secondary steelmaking for slag deoxidation .

The term dross derives from the Old English word dros , meaning the scum produced when smelting metals (extracting them from their ores). By the 15th century it had come to refer to rubbish in general. Dregs , and the geological term druse are also thought to be etymologically related. Popular non- metalworking uses of the word are derogatory:
