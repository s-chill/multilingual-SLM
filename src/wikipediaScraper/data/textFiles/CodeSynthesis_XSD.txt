CodeSynthesis XSD is an XML Data Binding compiler for C++ developed by Code Synthesis and dual-licensed under the GNU GPL and a proprietary license. Given an XML instance specification ( XML Schema ), it generates C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as well as parsing and serialization code. It is supported on a large number of platforms, including AIX , Linux , HP-UX , OS X , Solaris , Windows , OpenVMS , and z/OS . Supported C++ compilers include GNU G++ , Intel C++ , HP aCC , Solaris Studio C++ , IBM XL C++ , and Microsoft Visual C++ . A version for mobile and embedded systems, called CodeSynthesis XSD/e , is also available.

One of the unique features of CodeSynthesis XSD is its support for two different XML Schema to C++ mappings: in-memory C++/Tree and stream-oriented C++/Parser. The C++/Tree mapping is a traditional mapping with a tree-like, in-memory data structure. C++/Parser is a new, SAX -like mapping which represents the information stored in XML instance documents as a hierarchy of vocabulary-specific parsing events. In comparison to C++/Tree, the C++/Parser mapping allows one to handle large XML documents that would not fit in memory, perform stream-oriented processing, or use an existing in-memory representation. The XSD-generated code can target C++98/03 or C++11.

CodeSynthesis XSD itself is written in C++.
