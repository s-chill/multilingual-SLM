Red Hat is the largest contributor to the Ceph Storage SDS project : Block, File & Object Storage which runs on industry-standard x86 servers and Ethernet IP as well as ARM, InfiniBand, and other technologies.

Ceph aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level.

Ceph replicates data and makes it fault-tolerant, using commodity hardware and requiring no specific hardware support. Ceph's system offers disaster recovery and data redundancy through techniques such as replication, erasure coding, snapshots and storage cloning. As a result of its design, the system is both self-healing and self-managing, aiming to minimize administration time and other costs.

In this way, administrators have a single, consolidated system that avoids silos and collects the storage within a common management framework. Ceph consolidates several storage use cases and improves resource utilization. It also lets an organization deploy servers where needed.

Red Hat operates OpenShift , a cloud computing platform as a service , supporting applications written in Node.js , PHP , Perl , Python , Ruby , JavaEE and more.
