The Unix command fuser is used to show which processes are using a specified computer file , file system , or Unix socket .

For example, to check process IDs and users accessing a USB drive:

The command displays the process identifiers (PIDs) of processes using the specified files or  file
systems.   In the default display mode, each PID is followed by a
letter denoting the type of access:

Only the PIDs are written to standard output . Additional information is written to standard error. This makes it easier to process the output with computer programs.

The command can also be used to check what processes are using a network port:

The command returns a non-zero code if none of the files are
accessed or in case of a fatal error. If at least one access has succeeded, fuser returns zero. 
The output of "fuser" may be useful in diagnosing "resource busy" messages arising when attempting to unmount filesystems.
