The comparison of mail servers covers mail transfer agents (MTAs) , mail delivery agents , and other computer software that provide e-mail services.

Unix -based mail servers are built using a number of components because a Unix-style environment is, by default, a toolbox operating system. A stock Unix-like server already has internal mail; more traditional ones also come with a full MTA already part of the standard installation.  To allow the server to send external emails, an MTA such as Sendmail , Postfix , or Exim is required. Mail is read either through direct access ( shell login) or mailbox protocols like POP and IMAP . Unix-based MTA software largely acts to enhance or replace the respective system's native MTA.

Microsoft Windows servers do not natively implement e-mail, thus Windows-based MTAs have to supply all the necessary aspects of e-mail-related functionality.
