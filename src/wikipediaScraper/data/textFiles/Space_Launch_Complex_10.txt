Space Launch Complex 10 , or Missile Launch Complex 10 , is located on Vandenberg Space Force Base in Lompoc, California . It was built in 1958 to test ballistic missiles and developed into a space launching facility in 1963. Prior to 1966 Space Launch Complex 10 West was known as Vandenberg AFB Pad 75-2-6. It remains a rare pristine look at the electronics and facilities created in that era that helped the United States grow its space capabilities.

The last launch from this complex was a Thor booster in 1980. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

It is undergoing an eight-year restoration, and public visits are possible, if arranged in advance.

The launch complex was built in 1958 by the Douglas Aircraft Corporation , and was first designated Complex 75-2.  At that time it consisted of three launch pads, which were used to train military operators of PGM-17 Thor ballistic missiles, and to conduct missile launch tests.  The first launches were conducted by the British Royal Air Force in June and August 1959. The facilities at SLC-10 were dismantled and transported to Johnston Island in support of Operation Dominic , a nuclear weapons testing project conducted there in 1962.

The launch complex was rebuilt in 1963 to support the development of Burner rockets, with two launch pads, designated SLC-10E and SLC-10W. Tests were conducted at SLC-10W from 1965 to 1980, using the Thor satellite launch vehicles , the first stages of which followed the design of the Thor missile.

Two launch pads and a prefabricated launch blockhouse are the principal surviving elements of the complex.  The blockhouse interior still includes all of the electrical equipment used in later launches.  SLC-10W also includes pipes and storage facilities for storing and managing the liquid fuel used in the rockets.
