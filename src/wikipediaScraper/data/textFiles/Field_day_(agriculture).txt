A field day is a large trade show for agricultural industry and equipment, especially for broadacre farming . It contrasts with an agricultural show in that a show focuses on livestock and judging, a field day focuses on equipment, demonstrations and processes.

A field day may include events such as ploughing competitions not usually associated with shows due to the larger space required. The events are good sources of agricultural information, as organizers can arrange for guest speakers to talk on a range of topics.

New Zealand National Agricultural Fieldays is held at Mystery Creek, Hamilton, New Zealand and attracts 1,000 exhibitors and over 115,000 visitors through its gates. Smaller shows, held annually in New Zealand's towns and communities, are generally called Agricultural and Pastoral shows (A&P shows).
