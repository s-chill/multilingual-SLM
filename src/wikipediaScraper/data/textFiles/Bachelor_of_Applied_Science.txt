A Bachelor of Applied Science ( BAS or BASc ) is an undergraduate academic degree of applied sciences.

In Canada , the Netherlands and other places the Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) is equivalent to the Bachelor of Engineering , and is classified as a professional degree . In Australia and New Zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degree. In the United States , it is also considered a highly specialized professional technical degree; the Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) is an applied baccalaureate , typically containing advanced technical education in sciences combined with liberal arts education that traditional degrees do not have.  Yet, an earned BAS degree includes the same amount of required coursework as traditional bachelor's degree programs.

The BAS degree is designed to develop both theoretical and pragmatic knowledge (Bachelors Portal, n.d.). Compared to the Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BS), a BAS degree combines “theoretical and hands-on knowledge and skills that build on a variety of educational backgrounds” (Edmunds College, n.d.). BAS degrees often enhance occupational/technical education.

In February 2009, the Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Ronald Plasterk , proposed to replace all the existing degrees offered by Dutch vocational universities , such as the BBA , BEd and BEng , with the BAA and the BASc. Similarly, the United States has taken BAS as an official degree name.

The BAS usually requires a student to take a majority of their courses in the applied sciences , specializing in a specific area such as the following:
