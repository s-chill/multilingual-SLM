Grain size (or particle size ) is the diameter of individual grains of sediment , or the lithified particles in clastic rocks .  The term may also be applied to other granular materials . This is different from the crystallite size, which refers to the size of a single crystal inside a particle or grain. A single grain can be composed of several crystals . Granular material can range from very small colloidal particles , through clay , silt , sand , gravel , and cobbles , to boulders .

Size ranges define limits of classes that are given names in the Wentworth scale (or Udden–Wentworth scale named after geologists Chester K. Wentworth and Johan A. Udden ) used in the United States . The Krumbein phi (φ) scale, a modification of the Wentworth scale created by W. C. Krumbein in 1934, is a logarithmic scale computed by the equation

where

This equation can be rearranged to find diameter using φ:

In some schemes, gravel is anything larger than sand (comprising granule, pebble, cobble, and boulder in the table above).

ISO 14688-1:2017, establishes the basic principles for identifying and classifying soils based on those material and mass characteristics most commonly used for soils for engineering purposes. ISO 14688-1 applies to natural soils in situ , similar man-made materials in situ and soils redeposited by people.

An accumulation of sediment can also be characterized by the grain size distribution. A sediment deposit can undergo sorting when a particle size range is removed by an agency such as a river or the wind. The sorting can be quantified using the Inclusive Graphic Standard Deviation:

where

The result of this can be described using the following terms:
