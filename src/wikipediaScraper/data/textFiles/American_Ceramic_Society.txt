The American Ceramic Society ( ACerS ) is a nonprofit organization of professionals for the ceramics community, with a focus on scientific research , emerging technologies, and applications in which ceramic materials are an element. ACerS is located in Westerville, Ohio .

ACerS comprises more than 11,000 members from 75 countries, with membership including engineers, scientists, researchers, manufacturers, plant personnel, educators, students, and marketing and sales representatives.

The society publishes the following journals:

Journal of the American Ceramic Society ( JACerS )

International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology ( ACT )

International Journal of Applied Glass Science ( IJAGS )

International Journal of Ceramic Engineering & Science ( IJCES )

ACerS was established on April 6, 1898, in Columbus, Ohio by members of the National Brick Manufacturer's Association.

At the dawn of the 20th century, amidst the rapid industrialization of the United States, the importance of ceramics in technological advancements was becoming increasingly apparent. In response to this need, ACerS was formed with the dedication to promoting scientific research, technical advancements, and the practical applications of ceramic materials. The previous year at the association's annual convention in Pittsburgh, Elmer E. Gorton of American Terra Cotta & Ceramic Co. presented a paper entitled â€œExperimental Work, Wise and Otherwise." This paper was significant for being the first presented at the convention with a scientific focus, and motivated the formation of a non-commercial society dedicated to the exchange of ideas and research on the science of ceramics. The initial meetings and conventions were centered around the ceramic and pottery industries, which were thriving in Ohio and neighboring states at the time. The American Ceramic Society was officially formed on February 6, 1899, at its first annual meeting, which was held in Columbus, Ohio .

In its early years, the Society's focus was primarily on the production of ceramics, addressing the challenges faced by manufacturers and researchers alike. This focus expanded over time to include diverse topics such as glass technology, refractories, and electronic materials.

After its establishment in the field of ceramics science, ACerS underwent considerable growth in membership, publications, and influence. In 1918, the society began publishing the Journal of the American Ceramic Society , which remains one of the most respected journals in the ceramics field. The Journal served as a platform to disseminate knowledge and research findings to the broader scientific community.

During World War II, ACerS scientists contributed significantly to the war effort by supporting the development of advanced ceramic materials for military applications, including radar technology, armor plating, and heat-resistant components for aircraft and rockets. ACerS members played a crucial role in advancing the development of ceramic materials for defense, aerospace, and electronics applications. The society's involvement in these industries helped establish its reputation as a leader in ceramics research and development.

Following World War II, the ceramics industry experienced rapid growth, propelled by technological advancements in materials science. As a result, ACerS expanded its scope to include new areas of research, such as electronic ceramics, advanced structural ceramics, and biomaterials. To accommodate these growing fields, ACerS established various divisions and technical interest groups to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among members.

During this period, the society launched additional publications, such as the International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology and the International Journal of Applied Glass Science, to cater to the diverse interests of its members. ACerS' commitment to research and innovation contributed to the development of materials that had a significant impact on various industries, including aerospace, automotive, and biomedical.

ACerS has also been instrumental in establishing and supporting various technical divisions, aimed at promoting specialized research and collaboration within specific areas of ceramic science and engineering. These divisions include the Electronics, Glass and Optical Materials, Nuclear and Environmental Technologies, and Structural Clay divisions, among others.

ACerS is organized into the following twelve divisions:

Keramos was founded by ACerS in 1902 as a professional fraternity of ceramic engineering.  It has active chapters at University of Arizona , University of Florida , Georgia Institute of Technology , University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , Iowa State University , Missouri University of Science and Technology , Rutgers University , New York State College of Ceramics , Ohio State University , Pennsylvania State University , Clemson University , and University of Washington .

The National Institute of Ceramic Engineers (NICE) works with ABET to accredit collegiate programs in ceramics.  Materials science and engineering programs that offer an option to specialize in ceramics are accredited by NICE in conjunction with The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society ( TMS ).  NICE is also responsible for writing and administering the Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam in ceramics engineering.

The Ceramic Educational Council was founded in 1938 with the goal of improving ceramics education.
