A gold–silver–bronze command structure is a command hierarchy used for major operations by the emergency services of the United Kingdom .

Some practitioners use the term strategic–tactical–operational command structure instead, but the different categories are equivalent. In some cases, the national government (via the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms ) will assume ultimate control and act as a "platinum" level.

The effectiveness of elements of interoperability and communications with this structure have been called into question by the Pollock Report of 2013.
