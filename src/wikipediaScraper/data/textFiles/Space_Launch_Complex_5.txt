Space Launch Complex 5 ( SLC-5 ) was a launch pad at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California , United States . It was previously part of the Point Arguello Naval Air Station, during which time it was designated Launch Complex D or LC-D . Constructed in 1961, it was used by 69 Scout launch vehicles between 1962 and 1994. Satellites launched from the complex included Transit , OV3 , Explorer and P35 (DMSP) spacecraft. Most of the satellites launched from SLC-5 were placed into low Earth orbits , or low medium Earth orbits .

As of 2009*, the complex is still standing, however the U.S. Air Force is considering demolishing it to salvage parts. If the complex is dismantled, there are plans to produce a Historic American Engineering Record of the site, and to preserve the tower.
