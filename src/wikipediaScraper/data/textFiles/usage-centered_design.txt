Usage-centered design is an approach to user interface design based on a focus on user intentions and usage patterns. It analyzes users in terms of the roles they play in relation to systems and employs abstract (essential) use cases for task analysis . It derives visual and interaction design from abstract prototypes based on the understanding of user roles and task cases .

Usage-centered design was introduced by Larry Constantine and Lucy Lockwood. The primary reference is their book.

Usage-centered design is largely based on formal, abstract models such as models of interaction between user roles, UML workflow models and task case and role profiles.
Usage-centered design proponents argue for abstract modelling while many designers use realistic personas , scenarios and high-fidelity prototypes . The techniques have been applied with particular success in complex software projects, some of which have been reported in case studies.

Usage-centered design share some common ideas with activity-centered design . It is concerned more with the activities of users but not the users per se. Constantine (2006) presents an integrated framework where the models of Usage-centered design are enriched with concepts from the Activity theory .
