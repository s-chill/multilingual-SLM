Line representations in robotics are used for the following:

When using such line it is needed to have conventions for the representations so they are clearly defined.  This article discusses several of these methods.

A line L ( p , d ) {\displaystyle L(p,d)} is completely defined by the ordered set of two vectors:

Each point x {\displaystyle x} on the line is given a parameter value t {\displaystyle t} that satisfies: x = p + t d {\displaystyle x=p+td} . The parameter t is unique once p {\displaystyle p} and d {\displaystyle d} are chosen. The representation L ( p , d ) {\displaystyle L(p,d)} is not minimal, because it uses six parameters for only four degrees of freedom. The following two constraints apply:

Arthur Cayley and Julius Plücker introduced an alternative representation using two free vectors. This representation was finally named after Plücker. The Plücker representation is denoted by L p l ( d , m ) {\displaystyle L_{pl}(d,m)} . Both d {\displaystyle d} and m {\displaystyle m} are free vectors: d {\displaystyle d} represents the direction of the line and m {\displaystyle m} is the moment of d {\displaystyle d} about the chosen reference origin. m = p × d {\displaystyle m=p\times d} ( m {\displaystyle m} is independent of which point p {\displaystyle p} on the line is chosen!) The advantage of the Plücker coordinates is that they are homogeneous. A line in Plücker coordinates has still four out of six independent parameters, so it is not a minimal representation. The two constraints on the six Plücker coordinates are

A line representation is minimal if it uses four parameters, which is the minimum needed to represent all possible lines in the Euclidean Space (E³).

Jaques Denavit and Richard S. Hartenberg presented the first minimal representation for a line which is now widely used. The common normal between two lines was the main geometric concept that allowed Denavit and Hartenberg to find a minimal representation.  Engineers use the Denavit–Hartenberg convention(D–H) to help them describe the positions of links and joints unambiguously.  Every link gets its own coordinate system .  There are a few rules to consider in choosing the coordinate system:

Once the coordinate frames are determined, inter-link transformations are uniquely described by the following four parameters:

The Hayati–Roberts line representation, denoted L h r ( e x , e y , l x , l y ) {\displaystyle L_{hr}(e_{x},e_{y},l_{x},l_{y})} , is another minimal line representation, with parameters:

This representation is unique for a directed line. The coordinate singularities are different from the DH singularities: it has singularities if the line becomes parallel to either the X {\displaystyle X} or Y {\displaystyle Y} axis of the world frame.

The product of exponentials formula represents the kinematics of an open-chain mechanism as the product of exponentials of twists , and may be used to describe a series of revolute, prismatic, and helical joints.
