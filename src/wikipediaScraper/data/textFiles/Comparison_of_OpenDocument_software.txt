The OpenDocument format (ODF), an abbreviation for the OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications, is an open and free (excluding maintenance and support) document file format for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), spreadsheets , databases , charts , and presentations.  This standard was developed by the OASIS industry consortium, based upon the XML -based file format originally created by OpenOffice.org , and ODF was approved as an OASIS standard on May 1, 2005. It became an ISO standard, ISO/IEC 26300, on May 3, 2006.

The following tables list applications supporting OpenDocument 1.0 (ISO/IEC 26300:2006) and OpenDocument 1.1 (OASIS Standard).

Besides word processors, other programs can and do support the OpenDocument text format. See the List of applications supporting OpenDocument for more.

Root elements in ODF files take an office:version attribute, which indicates which version of OpenDocument Format specification it complies with. The version number is in the format revision.version. If the file has a version known to an XML processor, it may validate the document. Otherwise, it is optional to validate the document, but the document must be well formed.
