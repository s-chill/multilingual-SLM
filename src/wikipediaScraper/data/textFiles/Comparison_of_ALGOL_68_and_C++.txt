ALGOL 68 doesn't have:

Assigning values into an A68 union variable is automatic, 
the type is "tagged" to the variable, but pulling the value back out is 
syntactically awkward as a conformity-clause is required.

ALGOL 68 example:

C++ example:

The net effect of "type-tagging" is that Algol68's strong typing
"half" encroaches into the union .

A new mode (type) may be declared using a mode declaration:

This has the similar effect as the following C++ code:

Note that for ALGOL 68 only the newtype name appears to the left of the equality, and most notably the construction is made - and can be read - from left to right without regard to priorities.
