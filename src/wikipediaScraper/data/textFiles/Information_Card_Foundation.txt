Information Card Foundation (ICF) is an independent non-profit organization created in June 2008. The ICF consists of Steering Community board members and Steering Business board members. Some of the businesses include Equifax , Google , Microsoft , Novell , Oracle Corporation and PayPal . The foundation was formed to promote Information Card technology, a user-centric, cross-platform, identity technology that shifts control over personal information to the individual. Information cards allow the user to the control release of self-asserted claims or claims made by a third-party identity provider (called a "card issuer") represented using a card/wallet metaphor in a user interface (web or smart client) called a "card selector", to relying parties (i.e. apps and websites)
