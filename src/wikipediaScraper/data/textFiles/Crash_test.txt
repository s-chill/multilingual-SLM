A crash test is a form of destructive testing usually performed in order to ensure safe design standards in crashworthiness and crash compatibility for various modes of transportation (see automobile safety ) or related systems and components.

Crash tests are conducted under rigorous scientific and safety standards .  Each crash test is very expensive so the maximum amount of data must be extracted from each test.  Usually, this requires the use of high-speed data-acquisition, at least one triaxial accelerometer and a crash test dummy , but often includes more.

Some organizations that conduct crash tests include Calspan , an independent test laboratory in Buffalo, NY. As a result of the capabilities and expertise at Calspan, Calspan has been awarded 5 year contracts by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to execute for the NHTSA FMVSS No. 214, Side Impact Protection Compliance Testing, FMVSS No. 301 Fuel System Integrity, and FMVSS No. 305 Electric Powered Vehicles: Electrolyte Spillage and Electrical Shock Protection vehicle crash tests.  Calspan also holds the NHTSA contracts for executing New Car Assessment Program crash tests.

Also, Monash University department of Civil Engineering , routinely conducts crash tests for the purposes of roadside barrier safety and design.

There are a number of crash test programs around the world dedicated to providing consumers with a source of comparitative information in relation to the safety performance of new and used vehicles. Examples of new car crash test programs include National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 's NCAP, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , Australasian New Car Assessment Program , EuroNCAP and JapNCAP . Programs such as the Used Car Safety Ratings provide consumers information on the safety performance of vehicles based on real world crash data.

In 2020, EuroNCAP introduces a mobile progressive deformable barrier (MPDB) test first experimented on the Toyota Yaris.
