In Europe , Google Street View began on 2 July 2008 with the route of Tour de France being covered in parts of France and Italy . The service has since expanded to many European countries, while at the same time has been controversial in some countries due to laws and privacy concerns .

Following the introduction of Street View in the United States , there was talk of bringing the feature to Europe as well, but there were concerns over the legality of the feature due to stricter laws in most European countries than those of the United States regarding photography .

The first views anywhere outside the United States were introduced on July 2, 2008, when the Tour de France route was added. Nineteen camera icons, each indicating part of a French city or town and Cuneo , Italy, were included.

On October 14, 2008, camera icons were introduced in six French cities, Lille , Lyon , Marseille , Nice , Paris and Toulouse . At the same time, all other icons that had been introduced in France on July 2, as well as the one in Cuneo , Italy , were removed, representing the first time in Street View's history that a camera icon that once marked a place was removed. However, the amount of coverage that France had since July 2 was not diminished.

On October 27, 2008, four Spanish metropolitan areas were added to the list of growing street view locations in Europe: Madrid , Barcelona , Seville and Valencia .

On October 29, 2008, Italy received four camera icons for the localities of Florence , Milan , Rome and Lake Como .

Street View has been controversial in different countries for various reasons.

In September 2010, the Czech Republic banned any further capturing of Street View images. This occurred after more than half a year of unsuccessful negotiation between the Czech Republic and Google. However, on June 24, 2011, the cars started driving again, with the camera holder lowered by 30 cm (12 in) for privacy reasons.

In November 2010, a British watchdog group said that Google broke the law by obtaining personal data from people. The British government said the company would not be fined for the breach.

In March 2011, legal action against Google Street View in Germany resulted in court ruling that the project is legal; however, Google later decided not to expand or update existing coverage of Germany by the service.

In April 2011, a temporary ban on Google Street View data collecting in Austria was lifted, after being imposed by national data protection agency in May 2010. Google announced it was satisfied with the decision, but also stated that it had no plans to offer Google Street View coverage in Austria in the foreseeable future. In July 2018 general street coverage was introduced in Austria.

In April 2013 Google was fined €145,000 for illegally recording information from unsecured wireless networks in Germany.

There is some criticism of privacy concerns as well.

Below is a list of the countries that do not currently have official coverage where Street View vehicles are currently driving, where Street View is officially planned, or have reported by media to be driving.
