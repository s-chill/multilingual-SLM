A bicycle shifter or gear control or gear levers is a component used to control the gearing mechanisms and select the desired gear ratio . Typically, they operate either a derailleur mechanism or an internal hub gear mechanism. In either case, the control is operated by moving a cable that connects the shifter to the gear mechanism.

Traditionally shifters were mounted on the down tube of the frame or stem . For ergonomic reasons, they tend to be located somewhere on the handlebars on modern bicycles.

There are various types of shifter:

In 1990, Shimano introduced their Shimano Total Integration , STI, shifting levers for road bicycles, this was an indexed shifting system and the first to integrate shifting with the brake levers. Campagnolo soon followed with their ErgoPower system. The SRAM Double Tap was introduced in 2005.
