Site 41 was a complex of three launch pads at the Baikonur Cosmodrome originally built for flight testing of Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) using storable propellant. The need to develop such missiles was determined by low-tactical-technical and operational characteristics of the first Soviet ICBM R-7 created by the OKB-1 under the guidance of Sergei Pavlovich Korolev . May 13, 1959 by a special decree of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the CM of the design Bureau «Yuzhnoye» (Chief designer- Mikhail K. Yangel ) assigned to develop an Intercontinental ballistic missile on storable components of propellant, which has received designation R-16 and index – 8К64 . Together with 41 platform built platform No. 42 – technical and No. 43 – for residing of serving military personnel and representatives of the industry.

In the second half of 1959, construction work began on the construction of the forties sites [1] . Construction of pad for IBR R-16 , consisting of the two launches, was entrusted E. I. Nikolaev.  Thousands of employees of military engineers and civil subcontracting organizations, UPR Durova D. day and night worked with wholeheartedly. On the home page and technical exchanges were first ready-made premises and facilities. They began to mount the equipment. In April 1960 began construction of roads. In the month of may there were opportunities to resettle some of the soldiers in the capital, stone barracks, were ready hostel for officers-builders and customers. The supervision of construction and landfill everything was done to make life easier for a large mass of people. In August the construction work on the sites 41, 42, 43 were completed. And by 17 October 1960 and equipment erection works on objects of sites No. 41, 42 and 43 were finished.

26 September 1960 at the Baikonur cosmodrome came the first flight of the rocket product 8К64 No. LSD1-ST. In September 1960, was approved by the state Commission for the flight tests of ICBMs R-16 . The Chairman of the Commission was appointed Deputy Minister of defence Commander-in-chief of the strategic missile forces Chief Marshal of artillery and rocket forces M. I. Nedelin , the technical leader tests – Chief designer of OKB-586 - Mikhail K. Yangel . Until October 20, were carried out complex tests of all systems of the rocket in the Assembly-test complex, and on the morning of 21 October 1960 rocket was rolled out from Assembly and testing facility and delivered to the 41-St platform. 21 and 22 October been held under the prelaunch preparation of the docking head, lifting and installation of the rocket on the launch pad, communication connection and testing of all systems. 23 October missile was filled with the propellant components and compressed gases. By decision of state Commission rocket launch was appointed by 19:00 on October 23. But the identified faults forced Госкомиммию postpone the start of a rocket on October 24. First half of the day on October 24, would eliminate the defects. Around 18:45, was declared a 30-minute readiness for launch and started exhibiting in zero software токораспределителя. Occurred unauthorized starting of the engine of the second stage. Fiery stream destroyed the tanks of the oxidant and fuel in the first stage. An avalanche burning lasted about 20 seconds, after which the remains of the units and buildings were burnt down in two hours.
