In automotive engineering , a manettino dial is a rotary switch part of some modern Ferrari cars first designed by Frank Stephenson , beginning with the Ferrari F430 in 2004. The adjustment dial is mounted on the steering wheel , usually just underneath the center of the wheel. The dial ( Italian : manettino , lit. 'little lever') is inspired by the controls found on F1 steering wheels , but have a more polished appearance.

The dial allows for the quick and simple adjustment of the electronics governing car suspension settings, traction control , electronic differential , and change speed of electronic gearbox .

A similar control system was employed on the Ferrari Enzo , but used individual buttons for different settings rather than a single rotary switch.
