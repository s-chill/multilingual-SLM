A brougham is a 19th century four-wheeled carriage drawn by a single horse. It was named after the politician and jurist Lord Brougham , who had this type of carriage built to his specification by London coachbuilder Robinson & Cook in 1838.

The brougham has an enclosed body with two doors and sits two passengers; there are two fold-away seats in the front corners for small children. It has a box seat in front for a coachman plus one footman or passenger. The carriage body has a front window so that the passengers can see forward. The carriage is mounted on elliptical springs with small front wheels which can go under the carriage to turn sharply.

Features specific to the brougham include:

A variant, called a brougham-landaulet , has a top collapsible from the rear doors backward.

Broughams are a common means of transport in the Sherlock Holmes stories.

The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde mentions the brougham alongside a number of other carriage vehicles of the era, such as the omnibus , the hansom cab , the four-in-hand , and the victoria .

In L. P. Hartley 's novel The Go Between a brougham is sent to fetch the character Marian (chapter 23, p.274 [1st ed.]).

In the book The Alienist by Caleb Carr , a frequently used mode of transportation for the characters is a brougham.

In Rudyard Kipling 's poem " The Mary Gloster ", the dying Sir Anthony complains bitterly to his son about never seeing "the doctor's trusty brougham to help the missus unload" â€“ a reference to the effete Dickie's childless marriage and hence the extinction of his family.

In the novel The Crimson Petal and the White , by Michel Faber , William Rackham purchases a brougham as a surprise gift for his wife, Agnes Rackham, with the help of his beautiful mistress, a former prostitute known as Sugar.
