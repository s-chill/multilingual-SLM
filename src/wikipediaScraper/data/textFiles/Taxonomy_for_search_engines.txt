Taxonomy for search engines refers to classification methods that improve relevance in vertical search . Taxonomies of entities are tree structures whose nodes are labelled with entities likely to occur in a web search query . Searches use these trees to match keywords from a search query to keywords from answers (or snippets).

Taxonomies , thesauri and concept hierarchies are crucial components for many applications of information retrieval , natural language processing and knowledge management . Building, tuning and managing taxonomies and ontologies are costly since a lot of manual operations are required. A number of studies proposed the automated building of taxonomies based on linguistic resources and/or statistical machine learning. A number of tools using SKOS standard (including Unilexicon, PoolParty and Lexaurus editor to name a few) are also available to streamline work with taxonomies.
