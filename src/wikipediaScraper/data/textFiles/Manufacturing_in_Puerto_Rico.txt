Manufacturing in Puerto Rico is the largest economic sector in the economy of Puerto Rico ; composing almost half (about 46%) of the gross domestic product (GDP) of Puerto Rico . All manufacturers in Puerto Rico are in some way interconnected with the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO) which provides substantial incentives for companies that manufacture in Puerto Rico. Manufacturers are also voluntarily interconnected through the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association which serves as their primary trade association and their main lobby group upon the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico . Most manufacturing in Puerto Rico today is the product of Operation Bootstrap .
