A vehicle breakdown is a mechanical or electrical failure of a motor vehicle in such a way that the underlying problem prevents the vehicle from being operated or impedes the vehicle's operation so significantly that it is very difficult, nearly impossible, or else dangerous to operate.

Vehicle breakdowns have various causes. Depending on the severity, the vehicle may need to be towed to an automobile repair shop or fixed on-site by roadside assistance or a mobile mechanic . With other problems, the driver may be able to operate the vehicle seemingly normally for some time, but the vehicle will need an eventual repair. Many vehicle owners with personal economic difficulty or a busy schedule may wait longer than they should to get necessary maintenance or repairs made to their vehicles, thereby  increasing their chances of a breakdown, inducing further damage to the vehicle, or else causing more danger.
