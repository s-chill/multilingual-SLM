The architecture of Peja , Kosovo , describes a large mixture of architectural structures which are a reflection of the influential foreign rule all across the city. The architecture of the city consists of buildings, structures and constructions which were built with an architectural influence of the Byzantine architecture , Serbo-Byzantine architecture , Ottoman architecture , Stalinist architecture (former Yugoslavia), and Modern cultures/architectures. Because of this there are many churches, mosques, buildings which are attraction points in the city and were built by the aforementioned influences. The rule of the Ottoman and Serbian empires and the historical influence of former Yugoslavia (Communist era) have shaped the architectural landscape of the city to become a conglomerate of cultures.

The Patriarchate of Peć is a Serbian-Orthodox Monastery and serves as the seat of the Serbian archbishopric and patriarchs. It is believed that the Patriarchate was found when Saint Sava around 1235 was still alive and the site became a metoh (land owned and governed by a monastery).

The Patriarchate of Peć consists of four main structures (churches). Its main churches are the Holy Apostles church (1266), the Church of Saint Demetrius (1320), the Church of the Holy Virgin Hodegetria (1330), the church of Saint Nicholas. The decoration of the Church of Saint Demetrius was decorated with frescoes around 1345. Paint decoration was used for the exterior walls instead of creating a relief from stone and brick.

The Patriarchate of Peć was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 2004 as an extension to the Dečani Monastery , these structures can be found under the category of Medieval Monuments in Kosovo

In the 14th century the Church of the Holy Apostles was decorated since small modifications were made to it.

The Serbo-Byzantine architecture has been influenced by the Byzantine architecture and art traditions. Churches built with a Serbo-Byzantine architecture have a rectangular foundation, they have a central main dome with other smaller domes surrounding the main dome. A typical Serbo-Byzantine church has a rectangular foundation, with a major dome in the center with smaller domes around the center one. Usually Serbo-Byzantine monasteries/churches are decorated with frescoes that depict biblical stories.

Today, the Patriarchate of Peć has built a high wall in its outskirts and has a military/police post block at its entrance which is guarded by local police or KFOR as a security measure for the Serb minority live in the facilities.
