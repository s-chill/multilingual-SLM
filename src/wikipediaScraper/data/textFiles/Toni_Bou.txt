Antoni Bou i Mena ( Catalan pronunciation: [ənˈtɔni ˈβɔw] ) (born 17 October 1986) is a Spanish professional motorcycle trials rider. He has been the sole outdoor and indoor FIM Trial World Championship champion from 2007 to 2024. With these 36 world titles (18 outdoor and 18 indoor), he is the most successful rider in history, surpassing Dougie Lampkin (7 outdoor and 5 indoor) and Jordi Tarrés who is third with 7 outdoor titles. At the age of 20 years and 5 months, Bou was the second youngest rider ever to win the World Indoor Title, and the youngest to do it on a 4-stroke motorbike.

Toni Bou's first race win was in 1999, when he obtained the Catalan Cadet Trials Championship title at the age of 12. In 2001 he was the Spanish Junior Trials Champion. His World Trials debut was a 2003 appearance in Bangor, Ireland, he ended the season 13th in the World Outdoor Trials Championship, and 1st in the European Outdoor Trials Championship. His first World Trials win was in 2006 when he ended 5th in the outdoor championship, and 3rd in the indoor one. In the same year he was the Spanish Outdoor Trials Champion.

In 2007 he was World Trials Champion for the first time, both in the indoor and outdoor Championships. He has repeated this feat every year from 2008 to 2023.

In terms of National Team achievements, he has been part of the Spanish team, that obtained Trial des Nations wins in the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. He also achieved the same in the indoor version of the competition in the years 2006, 2007 and 2008.

The 2009 season was a perfect one for him, achieving all his objectives, as he won all the major 5 titles, including the indoor and outdoor world titles, the indoor and outdoor Spanish titles, and the Trial des Nations title. This feat was only achieved once before, by Adam Raga in 2005.

At the end of the 2017 season Bou signed an extended contract that will keep him with the Repsol Honda team until the year 2021, another three years.

In 2018, whilst facing stiff competition from his fellow countrymen Jeroni Fajardo and Adam Raga , Bou once again retained both his indoor and outdoor World titles.
