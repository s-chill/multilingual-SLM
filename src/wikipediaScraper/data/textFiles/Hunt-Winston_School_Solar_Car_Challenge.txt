The Solar Car Challenge is an annual solar-powered car race for high school students. The event attracts teams from around the world, but mostly from American high schools. The race was first held in 1995. Each event is the end product of a two-year education cycle launched by the Winston Solar Car Team. On odd-numbered years, the race is a road course that starts at the Texas Motor Speedway , Fort Worth , Texas ; the end of the course varies from year to year. On even-numbered years, the race is a track race around the Texas Motor Speedway . Dell sponsored the event from 2002-2008. Hunt Oil Company sponsored the 2010 race. Oncor sponsored the 2024 race.

The Solar Car Challenge is an educational program aimed at engaging high school students in designing, building, and racing solar-powered vehicles. Established in 1989 , the challenge promotes science, engineering, technology, and green energy solutions among youth.

In 1993 , the Solar Car Team expanded its efforts with the introduction of the Solar Education Program. This initiative teaches students how to construct roadworthy solar cars through curriculum materials, on-site visits, workshops, and virtual learning opportunities. The program's primary objective is to inspire students by applying scientific principles to real-world challenges.

The Solar Car Challenge features two main types of events:

Participants prioritize collaboration over competition, reflecting the ethos known as "The Spirit of Solar Car Racing." Outstanding team members are recognized annually through the prestigious Marx Award.

Per the 2023 race rules, teams compete in several divisions, each offering different technological opportunities and challenges:

Teams undergo a rigorous qualifying process known as "Scrutineering" to ensure compliance with safety and technical regulations. Each solar car is equipped with essential safety features including roll cages, safety harnesses, communication systems, and fire extinguishers. Support vehicles and trailers are also available during races to assist with technical issues and emergencies.

The Solar Car Challenge Foundation , recognized as a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization, has expanded its global outreach. Workshops, curriculum materials, DVDs, and on-site visits have introduced the challenge to over 1100 schools across 20 countries. This initiative continues to inspire the next generation of innovators in renewable energy technology.
