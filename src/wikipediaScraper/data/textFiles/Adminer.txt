Adminer (formerly known as phpMinAdmin ) is a tool for managing content in databases. It natively supports MySQL , MariaDB , PostgreSQL , SQLite , MS SQL , Oracle , Elasticsearch and MongoDB . Adminer is distributed under Apache license (or GPL v2 ) in a form of a single PHP file (around 470 KiB in size). Its author is Jakub Vr√°na who started to develop this tool as a light-weight alternative to phpMyAdmin , in July 2007. Adminer got some attention in 2008 when it made it to the CCA finals at SourceForge . Also, first webhosting providers  started to include Adminer as MySQL managing tool into their portfolio of services. In 2012 Adminer got coverage on Linux.com for the second time. The project's priorities, according to its author, are (in this order): safety, user-friendliness, performance, functionality, and size.

The small single file is a result of compilation and minification of source codes.
