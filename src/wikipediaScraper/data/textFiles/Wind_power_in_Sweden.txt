Sweden has a total of 16.4 GW of wind power capacity at the end of 2023, the 5th highest in Europe and most per capita. Wind power produced 20.9% of national electricity generation in 2023, up from 0.3% in 2000.

In July 2024, the Swedish Wind Energy Association (SWEA) projected that cumulative wind power capacity in the country will rise to 19.5 GW by the end of 2026.

Longer-term projections from other market analysts estimate 30 GW of wind power capacity by 2030.

The International Energy Agency 's (IEA) Wind Technology Collaboration Programme 2021 report outlines Sweden's progress in wind energy. By 2021, Sweden had achieved a total wind power capacity of 12.116 MW from 4,679 turbines. This aligns with Sweden's environmental goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions ( GHG ) by 40% by 2030 and aiming for net-zero emissions by 2045. Additionally, Sweden targets 100% renewable electricity production by 2040. Wind power generation in Sweden is expected to reach about 47 TWh by 2024, supported by growth in both onshore and offshore wind farm developments.

In 2021, the Swedish government ordered new transmission to be planned for offshore wind connections.

Sweden's wind power generation is set for a substantial increase, expected to rise by about 70% from 27.4 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2021 to 46.9 TWh by 2024, according to forecasts by the Swedish Energy Agency. This growth is supported by the addition of 2.1 gigawatts (GW) of wind power capacity in 2021, marking a significant increase to the country's renewable energy capabilities. This initiative is part of Sweden's plan to enhance its total net electricity production, which is expected to grow from 165.7 terawatt hours (TWh) to 183.5 TWh in the same period.

In 2022, Sweden's offshore wind sector had 15 gigawatts (GW) of projects in the permit application stage, expected to commence operations before 2030. The total project pipeline comprises 90 GW, with the majority not projected to be operational until after 2032. Notably, Vattenfall 's Swedish Kriegers Flak offshore wind farm, with a capacity of 640 MW, has obtained a permit and awaits the final investment decision.

The Association for Swedish Landscape Protection is in opposition to wind power. Their chairman says:

It is beginning to get through, I think, that with the existing nuclear and hydro power available in Sweden, the role for intermittent wind power is marginal and primarily as an exercise in the following of  ”fashion”. It has little to contribute to either generation capacity or transmission security. And it is expensive.

At the time of making the statement in 2011, wind power accounted for 4.3% of the electricity in Sweden as listed above. As of 2017 it accounted for 12.4%. Comparing the levelized cost of energy, as of November 2019 wind power was estimated at 28 to 54 USD per MWh, compared to 118 to 192 USD per MWh for nuclear power. Whereas according to the 2020 edition of Projected Costs of Generating Electricity, the levelized cost of energy of nuclear energy in Sweden is 28 to 32  USD per MWh.
