Medibuntu ( M ultimedia, E ntertainment & D istractions I n U buntu ) was a community-maintained repository of Debian packages that could not be included in the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons.

Reasons for non-inclusion include copyright, license or patent restrictions, or geographical variations in legislation, such as:

Much free software and non-free software is affected by such restrictions somewhere in the world, thus preventing its inclusion into Ubuntu. Medibuntu packaged and distributed such software. Downloading, using, distributing or otherwise dealing with software from Medibuntu was possibly illegal depending on the user's jurisdiction/region. Examples of software in Medibuntu were Acrobat Reader , non-free codecs, Google Earth , and RealPlayer .

As of October 2013, the Medibuntu Project has come to an end. The Medibuntu repository is unmaintained and offline.
