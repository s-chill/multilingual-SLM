Firewalls and Internet Security: Repelling the Wily Hacker is a 1994 book by William R. Cheswick and Steven M. Bellovin that helped define the concept of a network firewall . Describing in detail one of the first major firewall deployments at AT&T , the book influenced the formation of the perimeter security model, which became the dominant network security architecture in the mid-1990s.

In 2003, a second edition was published, adding Aviel D. Rubin to its authors.
