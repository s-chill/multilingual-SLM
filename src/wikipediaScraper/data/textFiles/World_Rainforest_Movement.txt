The World Rainforest Movement ( WRM ) is an international initiative created to strengthen the global movement in defense of forests, in order to fight deforestation and forest degradation . It was founded in 1986 by activists from around the world.

WRM believes that this goal can only be achieved by fighting for social and ecological justice, by respecting the collective rights of traditional communities and the right to self-determination of peoples who depend on the forests for their livelihoods.

For this reason, WRM's actions are oriented to support the struggles of indigenous peoples and peasant communities in defense of their territories.

WRM's International Secretariat is composed of a small team with members from different countries. The head office is in Uruguay .
