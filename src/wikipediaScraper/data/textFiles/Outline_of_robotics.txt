The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to robotics:

Robotics is a  branch of mechanical  engineering, electrical engineering and computer science that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.

The word "robot" was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) , published in 1920. The term "robotics" was coined by Isaac Asimov in his 1941 science fiction short-story " Liar! "

Robotics can be described as:

Robotics incorporates aspects of many disciplines including electronics , engineering , mechanics , software and arts .  The design and control of robots relies on many fields knowledge, including:

A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within.

Autonomous robots – robots that are not controlled by humans:
