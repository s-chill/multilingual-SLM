Planetary cartography , or cartography of extraterrestrial objects ( CEO ), is the cartography of solid objects outside of the Earth . Planetary maps can show any spatially mapped characteristic (such as topography , geology, and geophysical properties) for extraterrestrial surfaces. Some well-known examples of these maps have been produced by the USGS , such as the latest Geologic Map of Mars, but many others are published in specialized scientific journals.
