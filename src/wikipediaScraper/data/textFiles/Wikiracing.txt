Wikiracing is a game in which players compete to navigate from one Wikipedia page to another using only internal links . It has many different variations and names, including The Wikipedia Game , Wikipedia Maze , Wikispeedia , Wikiwars , Wikipedia Ball , Wikipedia Racing , and Wikipedia Speedrunning . External websites have been created to facilitate the game.

The Seattle Times has recommended it as a good educational pastime for children and the Larchmont Gazette has said, "While I don't know any teenagers who would curl up with an encyclopedia for a good read, I hear that a lot are reading it in the process of playing the Wikipedia Game".

The Amazing Wiki Race has been an event at the TechOlympics .

The average number of links separating any English-language Wikipedia page from the United Kingdom page is 3.67. Thus, it has been occasionally banned in the game. Other common rules such as not using the United States page increase the game's difficulty.

The rules of wikiracing can be used as a method for studying aspects of Wikipedia.
