Putcher fishing is a type of fishing (usually of salmon ) which employs multiple putcher baskets, set in a fixed wooden frame, against the tide in a river estuary , notably on the River Severn , in England and South East Wales . Putchers are placed in rows, standing four or five high, in a wooden "rank" set out against the incoming and/or outgoing tides.

Traditionally the putcher was made of hazel rods with withy ( willow ) plait, both materials being grown locally on the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels . Modern baskets made of steel or aluminium wire were introduced in the 1940s and 1950s.
