Forensic video analysis has been used in a variety of high profile cases, international disagreements, and conflict zones. Video forensics is necessary to show that images and videos used in court and media are verifiably true. Video forensics is especially important when media and governments use video coming from areas of state failure. Much of the video realized from inside Yemen and Syria have caused great political and public concern.
