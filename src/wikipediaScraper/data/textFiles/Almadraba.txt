Almadraba (a Spanish word coming from Andalusian Arabic : المَضْرَٰبَة , romanized: al-maḍraba , lit. 'the place to strike'; in Portuguese : almadrava ) is an elaborate and ancient technique for trapping and catching Atlantic bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus ).

The technique, in its most simple iteration, consists in setting up net barriers to trap the tuna when they migrate into the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean (February to July), on their way to spawn and
until recently, on their return journey, ("al revés"); the bycatch contains, among others, bullet tuna ( auxis rochei ), little tunny ( euthynnus alletteratus ), Atlantic bonito ( sarda sarda ), bigeye tuna ( thunnus obesus ) and swordfish ( xiphias gladius ).

It is a traditional form of fishing practiced mainly in southeastern Spain ( Andalusia , Murcia and southern Valencian Community ), Morocco and southern Portugal (the Algarve ). Almadrabas have been set from the ports of Cádiz , Chiclana de la Frontera , Conil de la Frontera , Barbate , Rota , Zahara de los Atunes , La Línea de la Concepción , Nueva Umbría, Isla Cristina , Ceuta and Tarifa , among other ports.

A similar technique exists in Sicily known as mattanza (a borrowing from the Spanish word matanza , meaning 'slaughter').
