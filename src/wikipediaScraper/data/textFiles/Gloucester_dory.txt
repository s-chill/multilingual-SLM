The Gloucester dory is a variant of the Banks dory , a type of narrow-bottomed, slab-sided boat, common in the North Eastern United States.  It is characteristically smaller and lighter, with less overhang, both bow and stern, and less freeboard . It retains the Banks dory's slab sides. Gloucester dories were designed to be launched through the surf behind a breakwater for daily fishing and lobstering off the Massachusetts shore.

Because of its simple lines, a Gloucester dory is relatively easy to build.  With the straight sides and flat bottom, stitch and glue techniques work well with this boat.
