freedesktop.org ( fd.o ), formerly X Desktop Group ( XDG ), is a project to work on interoperability and shared base technology for free-software desktop environments for the X Window System (X11) and Wayland on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems . Although freedesktop.org produces specifications for interoperability, it is not a formal standards body.

The project was founded by Havoc Pennington , a GNOME developer working for Red Hat in March 2000. Widely used open-source X-based desktop projects, such as GNOME, KDE's Plasma Desktop , and Xfce , are collaborating with the freedesktop.org project. In 2006, the project released Portland 1.0 (xdg-utils), a set of common interfaces for desktop environments. freedesktop.org joined the X.Org Foundation in 2019. Some of the project's servers are hosted by Portland State University .

freedesktop.org provides hosting for a number of relevant projects. These include:

Software related to windowing systems and graphics in general

Also, Avahi (a free Zeroconf implementation) started as a fd.o project but has since become a separate project.

XDG Base Directory Specification (XDG BDS) introduces a range of variables where user-specific files used by programs should be found. Many tools and applications utilize these variables by default.

Besides the variables mentioned below, XDG BDS also specifies that users' local binary files may be installed into $HOME/.local/bin . Systems compliant with the spec are expected to make this directory available in their CLI 's PATH environment variable.

The project aims to catch interoperability issues much earlier in the process. It is not for legislating formal standards. Stated goals include:
