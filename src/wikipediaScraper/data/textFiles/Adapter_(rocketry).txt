In rocketry , an adapter is a hollow cylindrical or conical segment which provides a sound aerodynamic and structural connection, either between rocket stages (oftern referred to as an interstage ) or between a spacecraft and the top rocket stage (referred to as a payload adapter). It may shroud and protect vulnerable systems such as electrics or machinery of rocket engines /spacecraft from weather or noise caused by running engines. It is discarded during staging .
