Petroleum production engineering is a subset of petroleum engineering .

Petroleum production engineers design and select subsurface equipment to produce oil and gas well fluids . They often are degreed as petroleum engineers , although they may come from other technical disciplines (e.g., mechanical engineering , chemical engineering , physicist ) and subsequently be trained by an oil and gas company.

Petroleum production engineers' responsibilities include:

Note: Surface equipments are designed by Chemical engineers and Mechanical engineers according to data provided by the production engineers.

Outflow should be defined as flow from the casing perforations to the surface facilities.
