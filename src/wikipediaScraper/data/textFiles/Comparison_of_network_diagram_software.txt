A number of tools exist to generate computer network diagrams. Broadly, there are four types of tools that help create network maps and diagrams:

Network mapping and drawing software support IT systems managers to understand the hardware and software services on a network and how they are interconnected. Network maps and diagrams are a component of network documentation . They are required artifacts to better manage IT systems' uptime, performance, security risks, plan network changes and upgrades.

These tools have capabilities in common with drawing tools and network monitoring tools. They are more specialized than general drawing tools and provide network engineers and IT systems administrators a higher level of automation and the ability to develop more detailed network topologies and diagrams. Typical capabilities include but not limited to:

These tools are specifically designed to generate automated network topology maps. These visual maps are automatically generated by  scanning the network using network discovery protocols . Some of these tools integrate into documentation and monitoring tools. Typical capabilities include but not limited to:

Some network monitoring tools generate visual maps by automatically scanning the network using network discovery protocols . The maps are ideally suited for viewing network monitoring status and issues visually. Typical capabilities include but not limited to:

These tools help users to create network topology diagrams by adding icons to a canvas and using lines and connectors to draw linkages between nodes. This category of tools is similar to general drawing and paint tools. Typical capabilities include but not limited to:
