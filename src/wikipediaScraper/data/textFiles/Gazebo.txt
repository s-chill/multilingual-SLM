Gazebo is an open-source 2D/3D robotics simulator that began development in 2002. In 2017, development forked into two versions, known as "Gazebo", the original monolithic architecture, and "Ignition", which had moved to becoming a modernized collection of loosely coupled libraries. Following a trademark obstacle in 2022 regarding their use of the name "Ignition", Open Robotics took the opportunity to switch the version names, dubbing the original fork "Gazebo Classic" and the new, modern fork "Gazebo".

Gazebo Classic integrated the ODE physics engine, OpenGL rendering, and support code for sensor simulation and actuator control.

Gazebo Classic can use multiple high-performance physics engines, such as ODE , Bullet , etc. (the default is ODE). It provides realistic rendering of environments including high-quality lighting, shadows, and textures. It can model sensors that "see" the simulated environment, such as laser range finders , cameras (including wide-angle), Kinect style sensors, etc.

For 3D rendering, Gazebo Classic uses the OGRE engine.

Gazebo was a component in the Player Project from 2002 through 2011. In 2011, Gazebo became an independent project supported by Willow Garage . In 2012, Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) became the steward of the Gazebo project. OSRF changed its name to Open Robotics in 2018.

Gazebo Classic's latest and last major release is version 11, a long-term support release with end-of-life planned for January 2025. All previously released versions of Gazebo also received long-term support, with minor updates being released for Gazebo 9 and 10 together with the release of Gazebo 11.0.0. With Gazebo 11 being released in January 2020, Open Robotics shifted its focus to developing Ignition, a "collection of open source software libraries designed to simplify development of high-performance applications", with a target audience of robot developers, designers, and educators. The first version of Ignition was released in February 2019. In April 2022, following a trademark dispute, the Ignition brand name was retired, and was reverted to Gazebo. Gazebo's website refers to the original standalone Gazebo simulator as Gazebo Classic in order to disambiguate it from Gazebo. Open Robotics mentioned the need for significant modernization in Gazebo's code, together with the opportunity to move from a monolithic architecture to a collection of loosely coupled libraries.

Gazebo has been used as the simulation environment for a number of technology challenges and competitions.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) put on the first ARIAC Competition in June 2017. The goal of the competition was to test the agility of industrial robot systems, with the goal of enabling industrial robots on the shop floors to be more productive, more autonomous, and to require less time from shop floor workers.
