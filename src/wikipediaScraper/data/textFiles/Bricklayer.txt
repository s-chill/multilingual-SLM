A bricklayer , which is related to but different from a mason , is a craftsperson and tradesperson who lays bricks to construct brickwork . The terms also refer to personnel who use blocks to construct blockwork walls and other forms of masonry . In British and Australian English , a bricklayer is colloquially known as a "brickie". A stone mason is one who lays any combination of stones, cinder blocks, and bricks in construction of building walls and other works. Bricklaying is a part of masonry.

Bricklaying may also be enjoyed as a hobby . For example, the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill did bricklaying as a hobby.

Bricklayers occasionally enter competitions where both speed and accuracy are judged. The largest is the "Spec-Mix Bricklayer 500" held annually in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.

Professional bricklayers usually go through a formal apprenticeship which includes about three to four years of on-the-job training combined with classroom instruction, though some bricklayers may learn entirely from on-the-job experience. Unions and employers may offer apprenticeships , which allow individuals with little or no experience in bricklaying to learn fundamental skills under a more experienced employee. Contemporary masons in many countries must attend trade school and/or serve apprenticeships in order to complete curricula signifying that that they understand fundamental related concepts such as the effects of humidity and water ingress, thermal insulation , and general knowledge regarding the science of construction materials, as well as occupational health and safety.
