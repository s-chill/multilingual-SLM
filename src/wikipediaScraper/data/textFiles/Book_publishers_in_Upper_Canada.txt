After the American Revolutionary War, U.S. printers were freed of British copyright restrictions and freely reprinted British works. Upper Canadian printers remained bound by British copyright. American presses quickly took the lead in producing cheap editions and eventually the printing of original work.

Publishing in Upper Canada was thus largely limited to local newspapers. The official Kings Printer published a large number of government documents, including the journal of the provincial Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council. During the 1830s, a series of directories and gazetteers were independently published. The only  substantial original works published were by David Willson , the religious leader of the Children of Peace , a utopian Quaker group who built the Sharon Temple .
