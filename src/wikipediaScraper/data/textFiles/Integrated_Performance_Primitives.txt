Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel IPP ) is an extensive library of ready-to-use, domain-specific functions that are highly optimized for diverse Intel architectures. Its royalty-free APIs help developers take advantage of single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instructions.

The library supports Intel and compatible processors and is available for Linux , macOS and Windows . It is available separately or as a part of Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit .

Intel IPP releases use a semantic versioning schema, so that even though the major version looks like a year (YYYY), it is not technically meant to be a year. So it might not change every calendar year.

The library takes advantage of processor features including MMX , SSE , SSE2 , SSE3 , SSSE3 , SSE4 , AVX , AVX2 , AVX-512 , AES-NI and multi-core processors . Intel IPP includes functions for:

Intel IPP is divided into four major processing groups: signal processing (with linear array or vector data), image processing (with 2D arrays for typical color spaces), data compression, and cryptography.

Half the entry points are of the matrix type, a third are of the signal type, and the remainder are of the image and cryptography types. Intel IPP functions are divided into 4 data types: data types include 8u (8-bit unsigned), 8s (8-bit signed), 16s , 32f (32-bit floating-point), 64f , etc. Typically, an application developer works with only one dominant data type for most processing functions, converting between input to processing to output formats at the end points.
