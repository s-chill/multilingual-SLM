In computing , the chaos model is a structure of software development . Its creator, who used the pseudonym L.B.S. Raccoon, noted that project management models such as the spiral model and waterfall model , while good at managing schedules and staff, didn't provide methods to fix bugs or solve other technical problems. At the same time, programming methodologies, while effective at fixing bugs and solving technical problems, do not help in managing deadlines or responding to customer requests. The structure attempts to bridge this gap. Chaos theory was used as a tool to help understand these issues.

The chaos model notes that the phases of the life cycle apply to all levels of projects, from the whole project to individual lines of code.

One important change in perspective is whether projects can be thought of as whole units, or must be thought of in pieces. Nobody writes tens of thousands of lines of code in one sitting. They write small pieces, one line at a time, verifying that the small pieces work. Then they build up from there. The behavior of a complex system emerges from the combined behavior of the smaller building blocks.

The chaos strategy is a strategy of software development based on the chaos model. The main rule is always resolve the most important issue first .

The chaos strategy resembles the way that programmers work toward the end of a project, when they have a list of bugs to fix and features to create. Usually someone prioritizes the remaining tasks, and the programmers fix them one at a time. The chaos strategy states that this is the only valid
way to do the work.

The chaos strategy was inspired by Go strategy.

There are several tie-ins with chaos theory .
