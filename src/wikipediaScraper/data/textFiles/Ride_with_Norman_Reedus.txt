Ride with Norman Reedus is an American docu-travel television series that premiered on AMC on June 12, 2016. The series follows actor and motorcycle enthusiast Norman Reedus where he and a guest of the week travel across a different destination on a motorcycle while exploring the city's biker culture and checking out various locales.

AMC ordered the series on October 29, 2015, with a premiere date set for June 2016. The idea came from AMC president of original programming Joel Stillerman, who called Reedus about doing a show about his love for motorcycles to which Reedus replied "Yes, yes, yes right away" before Stillerman could change his mind. Reedus picks the ride companion for each episode due to their history and location, like Peter Fonda who is known for appearing in the film Easy Rider .
