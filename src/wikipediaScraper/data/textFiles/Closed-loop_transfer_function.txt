In control theory , a closed-loop transfer function is a mathematical function describing the net result of the effects of a feedback control loop on the input signal to the plant under control.

The closed-loop transfer function is measured at the output. The output signal can be calculated from the closed-loop transfer function and the input signal.  Signals may be waveforms , images , or other types of data streams .

An example of a closed-loop block diagram, from which a transfer function may be computed, is shown below:

The summing node and the G ( s ) and H ( s ) blocks can all be combined into one block, which would have the following transfer function:

G ( s ) {\displaystyle G(s)} is called the feed forward transfer function, H ( s ) {\displaystyle H(s)} is called the feedback transfer function, and their product G ( s ) H ( s ) {\displaystyle G(s)H(s)} is called the open-loop transfer function .

We define an intermediate signal Z (also known as error signal ) shown as follows:

Using this figure we write:

Now, plug the second equation into the first to eliminate Z(s):

Move all the terms with Y(s) to the left hand side, and keep the term with X(s) on the right hand side:

Therefore,
