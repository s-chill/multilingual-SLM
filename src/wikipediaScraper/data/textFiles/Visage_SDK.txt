Visage SDK (distributed as visage SDK ) is a multi-platform software development kit (SDK) created by Visage Technologies AB . Visage SDK allows software programmers to build facial motion capture and eye tracking applications.

Face Track tracks 3D head poses, facial features, and eyes/gaze for multiple faces in a camera stream or from a video file. Face Track has configurable packages that include: facial tracking, face and facial landmarks/features detection , head tracking , and eye tracking.

Face Analysis includes machine learning algorithms to determine gender , emotions and age. Face Analysis is compatible with Face Track to find/track faces in images or video, determine gender, emotions, and age for a specified face.

Face Recognition is used to identify or verify a person from a digital image or a video source using a pre-stored facial data. Visage SDK's face recognition algorithms can measure similarities between people and recognize a person’s identity from a frontal facial image by comparing it to pre-stored faces.

The development of Visage SDK began in 2002 when Visage Technologies AB was founded in Linköping , Sweden. The founders were among the contributors to the MPEG-4 Face and Body Animation International Standard.

Visage SDK is used in various application fields, such as game development , arts and entertainment , marketing and retail , marketing research , automotive industry , industrial safety , assistive technologies , health care , biometrics , audio processing and robotics . Recently, visage SDK has been used to create solutions in virtual make-up and 3D face filtering .
