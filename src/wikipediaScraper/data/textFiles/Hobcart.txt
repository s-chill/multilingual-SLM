A hobcart was a type of mobility device designed in the late 1960s by Dr. Steven Perry of Albrighton , Shropshire , UK .

Dr. Steven had two young children, both of whom had spina bifida . He considered that the wheelchairs the children were provided with were liable to set them apart from other children of their age, so set about designing a mobility device that would look like a go-kart . The end result was the hobcart, which was produced at a local borstal when it was first made.

The idea behind this was to try to provide the inmates of the borstal the opportunity to be involved in a project which they could see was doing some good. Hobcarts were still being made into the 1980s.
