C++17 is a version of the ISO / IEC 14882 standard for the C++ programming language. C++17 replaced the prior version of the C++ standard, called C++14 , and was later replaced by C++20 .

Before the C++ Standards Committee fixed a 3-year release cycle, C++17's release date was uncertain. In that time period, the C++17 revision was also called C++1z , following C++0x or C++1x for C++11 and C++1y for C++14 . The C++17 specification reached the Draft International Standard (DIS) stage in March 2017. This DIS was unanimously approved, with only editorial comments, and the final standard was published in December 2017. Few changes were made to the C++ Standard Template Library , although some algorithms in the <algorithm> header were given support for explicit parallelization and some syntactic enhancements were made.

C++17 introduced many new features. The following lists may be incomplete.

This revision of C++ not only added new features but also removed a few.
