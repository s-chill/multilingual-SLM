A mountain railway is a railway that operates in a mountainous region . It may operate through the mountains by following mountain valleys and tunneling beneath mountain passes , or it may climb a mountain to provide transport to and from the summit .

Mountain railways often use narrow gauge tracks to allow for tight curves in the track and reduce tunnel size and structure gauge , and hence construction cost and effort. Where mountain railways need to climb steep gradients, they may use steep grade railway technology, or even operate as funicular railways .
