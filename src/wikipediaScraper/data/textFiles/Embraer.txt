Embraer S.A. ( Portuguese pronunciation: [ẽbɾaˈɛɾ] ) is a Brazilian multinational aerospace corporation . It develops and manufactures aircraft and aviation systems , and provides leasing, equipment, and technical support services. Embraer is the third largest producer of civil aircraft worldwide after Boeing and Airbus . The company also has a significant presence in military aviation , ranking among the top 100 defense contractors . It is headquartered in São José dos Campos , São Paulo , Brazil , with offices and operations in China, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, and the United States.

Embraer was founded in 1969 by the Brazilian government as a national champion for domestic aerospace technology. It initially focused on supplying military aircraft to the Brazilian Air Force , but by the 1980s began producing a series of successful commuter and regional airliners for export. The company was privatized in 1994 and began expanding to the production of larger regional airliners and smaller business jets . In 2000, Embraer became public as a limited company ( Sociedade Anônima ) with shares traded in both the United States ( NYSE ) and Brazil ( B3 ).

Embraer has divisions for commercial, executive, military, and agricultural aviation; it also maintains an incubator for aerospace technologies and businesses. While the company continues producing aircraft for the defense sector, it is best known for the ERJ and E-Jet families of narrow-body short to medium range airliners , and for its line of business jets , including the market-leading Phenom 300 . As of May 2024, Embraer has delivered more than 8,000 aircraft, including 1,800 E-Jet planes.

Seeking to develop a domestic aircraft industry, the Brazilian government under Getúlio Vargas ' Estado Novo made several investments in the aerospace industry during the 1940s and 1950s. However, it was not until 1969, following the establishment of the Brazilian military dictatorship after the 1964 coup d'état , that Em presa Br asileira de Aer onáutica (Brazilian Aeronautics Corporation, short Embraer) was created as a government-owned corporation . Its first president, Ozires Silva , was a government appointee, and the company initially only produced a turboprop passenger aircraft, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante .

The Brazilian government contributed to Embraer's early growth by providing production contracts. The company sold solely to the domestic market until 1975.

While military aircraft made up the majority of Embraer's products during the 1970s and early 1980s, including the Embraer AT-26 Xavante and the Embraer EMB 312 Tucano , it debuted a regional airliner , the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante , which made its first flight in 1968, and the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia , launched in 1985. Aimed at the export market, the EMB family was the first in a series of highly successful small and regional airliners.

In addition to its own line of aircraft, beginning in 1974, Embraer was licensed by the United States' Piper Aircraft to develop, produce, and market its light airplanes, as Brazil was one of the world's leading importers of small single- or twin-engine aircraft. Piper first put together knock-down kits in its U.S. factory for Embraer to then assemble and market in Brazil and Latin America. By 1978, most parts and components were being sourced by Embraer locally. The aircraft were sold as the EMB 820 Navajo (Piper Navajo Chifetais ), EMB 810 Seneca (Piper Seneca III) , EMB 720 Minuano (Cherokee Six) , EMB 710 Carioca aircraft (Cherokee 235 Pathfinder) and the EMB 711 Corisco (Cherokee Arrow II). Between 1974 and 2000, nearly 2,500 license-built Pipers were produced by Embraer.

Aerotec S/A Indústria Aeronáutica was a design and manufacturing company founded in São José dos Campos in 1962 under the auspices of the Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology .  Beginning in the late 1960s, the firm manufactured a two-seat trainer for the Brazilian Air Force, the Aerotec Uirapuru . A small number were also built for the civilian market, and others were exported to other Latin American countries.

By 1980, Aerotec's main business was producing components for Embraer. However, around this time, the Brazilian Air Force became interested in an upgraded version of the Uirapuru. A prototype, designated Uirapuru II , was built; but, by the time it flew, the Air Force no longer required it. A small number were built for export. In 1987, the firm was sold to Embraer.

Born from a Brazilian government plan and having been state-run, Embraer eventually started a privatisation process in 1992 alongside other state-run companies, such as Telebrás and Vale . Privatisation was a key policy of the economically liberal government of Fernando Collor , elected in the 1989 presidential election .

Embraer was sold to private investors on December 7, 1994, which helped it avoid a looming bankruptcy. The Brazilian government retained interest through possession of golden shares , which allow it veto power. Embraer continued to win government contracts throughout the 2000s and 2010s.

In 2000, Embraer made simultaneous initial public offerings on the NYSE and BM&F Bovespa stock exchanges. As of 2008 its NYSE-traded shares were American depositary receipts representing four BM&F Bovespa shares and it was partially owned by the Bozano Group (11.10%), Previ (16.40%), Sistel (7.40%), Dassault Aviation (2.1%), EADS (2.1%), Thales (2.1%), Safran (1.1%), and the government of Brazil (0.3% and golden share ), the remainder being publicly traded.

As of December 31, 2014 the shareholders with more than 5% of the company's capital were:

In the mid-1990s, the company pursued a product line focused on small commercial airplanes over the military aircraft that had previously made up the majority of its manufacturing. It soon expanded to the production of larger regional airliners in the 70–110 seat range, and smaller business jets .

By May 2019, Embraer considered developing a new family of turboprop regional airliners in the 50–70 seat range, complementing the E-Jet E2 , so as to free engineering resources. It would compete against older ATR and Dash 8 designs for 1.5 to 2 h flights over 500–700 nmi (930–1,300 km). In August 2021, Embraer released a new configuration with quieter aft-mounted engines for a 70-90 seat aircraft, with the E-Jet cross-section, aiming for a 2022 launch and a 2027/2028 service entry.

At the 2000 Farnborough Airshow , Embraer launched the Legacy 600 , a business jet variant of the Embraer Regional Jet . In 2002, a dedicated subsidiary, Embraer Executive Jets , was created, as the Legacy was introduced into service. In 2005, the Phenom 100 was first envisioned as an air taxi similar to the Eclipse 500 , competing with Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft . It was introduced in 2008 and is the basis of the larger Phenom 300 . The midsize Legacy 450 and Legacy 500 were jointly developed as clean sheet designs, while the Lineage 1000 is a VIP version of the E190 . In 2016, Embraer delivered its 1,000th executive jet and had a market share of 17% by volume, though it lacked an ultra-long-range large cabin jet. In October 2018 Embraer announced two new business jets—the Praetor 500 in the midsize cabin category—and the Praetor 600 in the super midsize category.

On April 19, 2007, Embraer announced it was considering the production of a twin-jet military transport. Work began in May 2009 with funding from the Brazilian Air Force. Correios , the Brazilian postal service, has shown interest in buying this aircraft. Using much of the technology developed for the Embraer 190, the C-390 would carry up to 23 tons of cargo and aims to replace Cold War -era cargo aircraft.

While firm orders for the yet-to-be-produced KC-390 transport had not yet been made in the fall of 2010, Argentina asked for six examples and several other South American nations also expressed interest.

Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic plane-makers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization determined that both countries had provided illegal subsidies to what were supposed to be privately owned industries. Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting its national aviation industry from at least 1999–2000, and Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry including in export contracts, comprising Bombardier Aerospace .

On July 5, 2018, a joint venture with Boeing was announced that would have resulted in Boeing owning 80% of Embraer's commercial aviation division. This was seen as a reaction to Airbus' acquisition of a majority in the competing Bombardier CSeries the previous year. Under the 2018 plan, Embraer would retain its executive business jet and its defence business . The resulting division would be known as Boeing Brasil – Commercial , though it was unclear whether the aircraft would be rebranded as Boeing models.

On November 18, 2019, Boeing and Embraer announced another joint venture, at 49% and 51% respectively, to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium tactical transport aircraft; the resulting entity would be called Boeing Embraer – Defense and would begin operating after regulatory approvals and closing conditions.

In April 2020, Boeing canceled its acquisition of Embraer's commercial operations after being heavily affected financially by the air crisis initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the 737 MAX groundings .

In November 2020, Embraer announced that its loss for the third quarter of the year is $121 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the travel restrictions.

In December 2019, Embraer and the Brazilian Air Force tackled the development of a light military transport aircraft . The Short Take Off Utility Transport (STOUT) would replace its 64 EMB-110 Bandeirante (average age of 38.3 years) and 19 EMB-120 Brasilia (average age of 26.5 years) with similar dimensions.

Embraer is organized into four segments: Commercial Aviation, which manages the development, production, sale, and lease of commercial jets, as well as the provision of aviation support services; Defense & Security, which consists of research, development, production, modification, and support for military defense aircraft, and related products and services; Executive Aviation, which concerns the development, production, and sale of executive jets, and support services; and Other, which entails the production of structural parts, mechanical and hydraulic systems, agricultural crop-spraying aircraft , and customer training.

The key trends of Embraer are (as at the financial year ending December 31):

The company's headquarters and main production base are in São José dos Campos , São Paulo , Brazil . It also has production bases in the State of São Paulo at Botucatu , Eugênio de Melo (a district of São José dos Campos) and Gavião Peixoto . The company has offices in Beijing , Fort Lauderdale , Amsterdam , Singapore , and Washington, D.C.

By December 2018, Embraer claimed to lead the sub 150 seat jetliner market with 100 operators of the ERJ and E-Jet families.

The numbers include military versions of commercial aircraft.
